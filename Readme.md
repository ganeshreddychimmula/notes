# My Digital Garden 🌱

Welcome to my personal collection of notes, thoughts, and work-in-progress ideas. This repository is my digital garden—a public space where I cultivate knowledge, connect ideas, and document my learning journey.

Feel free to look around; you might find something useful or interesting!

### 🚨 A Quick Note on Viewing

Please be aware that these notes are primarily written and maintained for my personal use in a local note-taking application (like Obsidian). As a result, some features may not work as intended when viewing the files directly on GitHub:

- **🔗 Internal Links:** Links connecting one note to another (e.g., `[[My Other Note]]`) will appear broken. They rely on a local file structure that doesn't translate directly to the web interface.
    
- **🖼️ Images and Attachments:** Embedded images, PDFs, and other attachments may not display correctly, as the media files are stored locally on my machine and are not included in this repository.
    

Despite these limitations, I hope the text content itself can provide some value. Thank you for visiting!
