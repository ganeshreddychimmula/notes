 As your knowledge network expands and tags accumulate a significant number of linked notes, they can be transformed into indexes. Since tags are already notes themselves, an index serves as a **table of contents** for notes related to a particular tag. It provides a logical structure and an entry point for exploring the notes within that tag. For example, a "learning" tag with 51 linked notes could be turned into an index with subheadings to organize those notes. This folder is for later use as your system grows.

In your Obsidian system, **indexes** serve as a crucial tool for navigating and structuring your growing knowledge network, especially as it becomes more complex.

Here's a breakdown of what indexes are and how they function:
- **Definition and Purpose**
    - An **index is almost like the contents page of a book** for your notes. Its primary job is to provide a logical structure and an **entry point for discussion** on a given topic.
    - As your knowledge network grows, it can become challenging to navigate, appearing like a "horrible ugly spider web". Indexes are designed to solve this problem by adding a **basic level of structure** to help you easily find what you're looking for.
- **Relationship with Tags**
    
    - In your system, **tags are just empty notes** stored in a dedicated "Tags" folder.
    - When a tag **gets big enough**, meaning you've connected a lot of notes to it, you can actually **turn this tag into an index**. This is done by filling the empty tag note with an organized structure. For instance, a "learning" tag with 51 relevant notes is a good candidate to be converted into an index, whereas a tag with only a few notes might not need one.
- **Creation Process**
    
    1. **Identify a suitable tag**: Choose a tag that has accumulated a significant number of linked notes.
    2. **Access the tag note**: Go inside the empty tag note (e.g., your "learning" tag).
    3. **Add subheadings**: Within this tag note, **add some subheadings**. These serve to categorize the related notes.
    4. **Link relevant notes**: Under each subheading, you then **link all of the notes that fit that category**.
- **Location in Your System**
    
    - Indexes are stored in the **"Indexes" folder**, which is the fourth folder in your described system. This helps to keep your entire system tidy and free from clutter.

By using indexes, you introduce order into your notes, ensuring that even a vast collection of ideas remains navigable and serves as a useful resource for future learning and creation.
