# Agile
Agile can be summarised very briefly:

- Only work on the most important things at any given point in time
    
- Break those things into small bite-sized tasks for individuals to work on autonymously
    
- Catch up for about 10-20 minutes every morning on progress
    
- Meet at the end of a set of 'things' to plan the next set of 'things'
    

Edit: As someone pointed out the flavour of Agile here is Scrum. Agile broadly can be summarised by the first two bullets.
