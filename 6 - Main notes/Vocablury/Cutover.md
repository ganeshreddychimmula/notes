# Cutover

The term "cutover" is one of the most important concepts in any migration project. 

In the context of the project( Airtable to Coda migration), **cutover** is the specific point in time when you officially switch from the old system (Airtable) to the new system (Coda).

Think of it like moving to a new house. You spend weeks packing boxes (building Coda) and getting everything ready. The "cutover" is the moving day itselfâ€”the moment you lock the door of the old house for the last time and declare the new house your official home.

After the cutover:

- **Coda becomes the "source of truth."** All new work, data entry, and operational tasks must be done in Coda.
    
- **Airtable is "frozen" or "decommissioned."** It should be made read-only to prevent people from accidentally using it and creating data that won't be in the new system. Eventually, it will be shut down entirely.
