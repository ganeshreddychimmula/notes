# How to Make Things Happen to Life

- Being Savvy

### **Prioritize: Define What Truly Matters**

It's easy to have a long list of things you want to achieve, but without clear priorities, you'll likely feel overwhelmed and make little progress.

**Actionable Steps:**

- **Create a "Life Goals" List:** Write down everything you want to achieve in the next 1, 5, and 10 years. Don't censor yourself; just get it all down.
    
- **Force Rank Your Goals:** Now, the hard part. You can't have five #1 priorities. You must decide what is most important to you _right now_. A helpful exercise is to ask yourself, "If I could only accomplish one thing on this list in the next year, what would it be?" That's your top priority.
    
- **Communicate Your Priorities (to Yourself):** Your priorities should be reflected in your daily and weekly actions. If your goal is to write a book, you should have dedicated writing time on your calendar. If it's to get in shape, your schedule should include workouts and meal prep.

### **Focus on the Critical Path: Identify and Overcome Obstacles**

In life, critical path is series of actionable steps you should take to achieve your goal.

**Actionable Steps:**

- **Break Down Your Goal:** Take your top priority goal and break it down into smaller, manageable steps. For example, if your goal is to change careers, your steps might include:
    
    1. Researching new career options.
        
    2. Identifying necessary skills or education.
        
    3. Enrolling in a course or certification program.
        
    4. Updating your resume and LinkedIn profile.
        
    5. Networking with people in your target field.
        
    6. Applying for jobs.
        
- **Identify Dependencies and Bottlenecks:** What's holding you back? Is there a particular skill you need to learn? A financial hurdle you need to overcome? A fear you need to confront? These are your bottlenecks. Your immediate focus should be on resolving them.
    
- **Ask "What's the Next Step?":** At every stage, ask yourself, "What is the one thing I can do right now to move this forward?" This keeps you focused on the critical path and prevents you from getting sidetracked by less important tasks.

### **Be Relentless: Persevere Through Challenges**

Achieving significant life goals is rarely a smooth journey. You will face setbacks, moments of doubt, and unexpected obstacles. Being relentless is about having the grit and determination to keep going.

- **Actionable Steps:**
    
    - **Embrace a "Problem-Solving" Mindset:** When you encounter a challenge, don't see it as a dead end. Instead, view it as a problem to be solved. Ask yourself, "What are my options? Who can I ask for help? What's a different approach I can take?"
        
    - **Celebrate Small Wins:** To stay motivated for the long haul, it's essential to acknowledge and celebrate your progress along the way. Did you finish a chapter of your book? Run a mile without stopping? Acknowledge your achievement.
        
    - **Learn from Your Failures:** Failure is not the opposite of success; it's a part of it. When you fail, take the time to understand what went wrong and what you can do differently next time.

### **Be Savvy: Navigate Your Environment with Intelligence**

Being savvy is about understanding the "soft skills" of achieving your goals. It's about knowing how to motivate yourself, when to ask for help, and how to navigate the social and personal dynamics that can impact your progress.

- **Actionable Steps:**
    
    - **Understand Your Own Psychology:** What motivates you? What demotivates you? Are you a morning person or a night owl? Work _with_ your natural tendencies, not against them.
        
    - **Build a Support System:** Surround yourself with people who support your goals. This could be friends, family, a mentor, or a coach.
        
    - **Be a Good Negotiator (with Yourself and Others):** You'll need to negotiate for your time and energy. This might mean saying "no" to social invitations so you can work on your goal, or negotiating with your partner about household responsibilities so you can free up time.
