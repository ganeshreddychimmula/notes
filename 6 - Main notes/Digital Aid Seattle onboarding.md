NOTE: The AirTable interfaces, including the onboarding material, will not be accessible on mobile.

Happy to have you on board!

### Vision

- Without taking advantage of new technological tools in current era, non profit's cannot make much of an impact.
- While what they do is important and much effort goes into that, the resources are very few.
- The mission is to ensure non-profits get equipped with technical support they need to adapt and modernize.

### Glossary (lingo)
- Acceptance Criteria (AC) define what specific results are needed for a task to be considered finished. They act as clear guidelines for determining if a deliverable meets expectations.
- The completeness of the task is indicated in a **Review**, and the results are articulated in a **Gap Analysis.**
- Cadre - Volunteers focused on building the Digital Aid Seattle ecosystem, as opposed to individual Ventures.
- Contributor - A volunteer who works on Ventures.
- Community of Practice - It often focus on sharing best practices and creating new knowledge to advance a domain of professional practice. Interaction on an ongoing basis is an important part of this.
- Directly Responsible Individual (DRI) - The person who is resposible to see the work is completed. They can seek and accept help, advice, etc., but in the end the DRI needs to ensure completion.
- Discipline - A skill a person has. A Discipline is different from a Role because each new applicant is drawn to work with DAS because they see themselves in a single advertised role (e.g. Social Media Manager, Front-End Engineer). However, each applicant frequently has several skills (i.e. Disciplines) they can provide to DAS.
- Meetings:
	- Plenary - All Cadre volunteers gather for updates and showcases
	- Team - Team members gather for collaboration
	- Task Group - Meeting specifically about a particular Task Group
	- Leadership - Leader from every Team gathers for inter-Team coordination
	- Ad Hoc - Any reason outside the above contexts
- Partner - The local agency, community, or non-profit organization for whom we build Deliverables.
- performance notes - The notes a DRI takes while completing a respective task. These notes can be for their own reference, or as a place to send messages to the person who will be receiving this task downstream.
- Proctor - A person who evaluates an applicant for discipline/role-specific competency.
- A "Role" is the way we describe to prospective volunteers what sort of person we're looking for.
- Task - Items of work appropriately sized for one person.
- OKR - ### Objective & Key Results
	-  We use OKRs in Digital Aid Seattle to ensure our teams focus toward long-term goals instead of just tactical things that come up from week to week.
	- Each team identifies their own OKRs, articulates them in their team's profile, and tracks whether or not they're on track in the OKR health fields.
	- Our OKRs run on a 6 month cycle.
	- Each team should have 1-3 OKRs each cycle.
- OKR Health - The confidence we feel, on a five point scale, that we will accomplish a given OKR by its due date.
- 

### Meeting expectations
Expectation setting:
If a person is going to miss a meeting;
- They need to add their updates to the agenda for others to read in their absence.
	- Minimum update should include how likely their forecast is to be satisfied
	- Include any help/advice they will need from this Team or others
- They'll need to read the notes from the meeting they missed, after the meeting (consistent with the Task that's created for them already)
Improve the minutes
- Let's all make a concerted effort to improve the notes taken in a call
- Each person on the call (even if they're not the one typing notes in that moment) should feel responsible to ensure notes captured are sufficient--jump in and collaborate in the notes taking
- Ensure key components are captured:*
	- Action items
	- Decisions
	- Reasoning
- Spend last 5 minutes of each meeting to agree that the notes are accurate and sufficient.

Plenary - The every other weekly meeting all Cadre volunteers attend (AKA all-hands)
- If you're providing an update, please type it into the Agenda at least an hour before the meeting _in language everyone on the team will understand, even those outside your discipline._ Include images or links if possible to _demo_.
- Attend unless impossible. If impossible, 
	- indicate your absence via the links on your personal dashboard. 
- Delegate any responsibilities you had for the meeting to another person, and indicate as much in the agenda’s relevant section

### Teams
Venture Evaluation Structure - 
- We pick up where Partner Relationships leaves off.
- We coach Partners in articulating pain-points, and then usher the pain-points through evolution toward scoped ventures ready to be handed off to a Squad of Contributors.

### Tools
-  Airtable - [Airtable](https://airtable.com/) is a database software with a user-friendly interface. We use it as a primary place to organize information, tasks, and keep track of each other’s work
- Fathom records, transcribes, highlights, and summarizes your meetings.
- The [shared Digital Aid Seattle](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0AK--y2tMwBuyUk9PVA) [**Google Drive**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0AAEc0q-gkFP5Uk9PVA) is the central storage site for all documentation and assets that DAS creates. It includes things like recorded meetings, instructional videos, language guides, email templates, and much more.
- [**Google Meet**](https://meet.google.com/?hs=197&authuser=0) is a cloud-based video communications app that allows you to set up virtual video and audio conferencing, webinars, live chats, screen-sharing, and other collaborative capabilities.
- We use HubSpot to track email communications.
	- Please be aware that all email comms you send or receive using your DAS account is logged.
	- https://knowledge.hubspot.com/connected-email/connect-your-inbox-to-hubspot
- [**Miro**](https://miro.com/) is the online collaborative whiteboard platform that enables distributed teams to work effectively together, from brainstorming with digital sticky notes to planning and managing agile workflows.
	- Our account is limited to three boards. Please don’t create another board or we’ll be locked out of one of our existing boards!
- [**Slack**](https://slack.com/) is a collection of chat rooms equipped for threaded conversations, emoji reactions, and app integrations.
- **Please note that all times in Airtable are listed as Pacific Standard Time (PST).**

### messaging
Being Thoughtful When Messaging Teammates

- Think before you type; be respectful and professional.
- Put enough information in your message to enable your recipient to respond when they’re available.
- When it is unclear which person on a team is the right person to answer a question, it can be directed to the team as a whole.

We have **TWO** distinct workspaces:

- Digital Aid Seattle (Cadre)
- Slack workspace for Cadre members, which are volunteers who focused on building the DAS ecosystem 
- Digital Aid Seattle Ventures
- Slack workspace for Contributors, which are volunteers who focus on the venture project

`#cop_[Discipline]`
- Community of Practice (COP) channels
- People in the channel:
- Volunteers possessing the respective Discipline
- Anyone else who has chosen to remain abreast of the Discipline's dialogue
- Naming convention: #cop_[discipline name].


Responding to Requests in a Timely Manner

- If it’s a request without an @[name] then we thread our own ability/willingness to assist. We may @ someone else in the thread we consider the request.
- If it’s a request directly to us, then we either react (emoji) to indicate that we’re working on it, that we can’t be of assistance, or that we’ve seen the request and intend to act on it at a specific time (immediately followed by transferring the activity to the relevant task management system, of course).
- If it's just meant as an asynchronous FYI, we may not respond at all, or we may give little reaction to indicate that the message landed.

### Miro
We use a free version of Miro which has a limit of three boards. If you ever create a new board, then we will exceed our available board count and will **automatically** lose access to one of our primary boards.

**Please NEVER create a board in Miro.** The boards we use have no edge limitations, so you can find nearly infinite available space for whatever you want to do.

###  Our team expectations
#### engagement

1. Actively participate on at least one team.
2. If, for reasons beyond your control, you are unable to meet and collaborate synchronously for any of the teams you are on, it is your responsibility to coordinate with that team’s leader to determine how you can contribute to that team’s work.
3. Finding things to work on: It takes a lot of time for leaders to identify and define discrete tasks for each person on the team. There will be times when they don’t have the time to define tasks for you. At these times, it will be up to you to surface DAS needs, strategize how you can satisfy those needs, manage your own execution, and communicate your process and deliverables to the team and project as a whole.

#### Professionalism

1. We don’t have the resources and time required to create a robust QA process. Please always consider at which point in the creation lifecycle your deliverable exists, and whether there will be subsequent reviews and iterations before publication.
2. Please exercise the same care and ownership you would at work. We’re all relying on you.
3. When engaging with external parties on behalf of DAS, exhibit the same level of competence and professionalism you would at work.
4. When engaging with others in DAS, (1) honor our culture principles and trust practices, and (2) don’t be an ass hole.

#### Meetings

1. Attend every Plenary if possible, ensuring you attend at least 75% of them. When you miss, ensure you read the meeting notes within 6 days of the meeting.
2. If you are ever going to miss a meeting, indicate (before the meeting’s start time) the reason for absence in the My Meetings interface. If there is no agenda, indicate via RSVP.
3. Be on time
