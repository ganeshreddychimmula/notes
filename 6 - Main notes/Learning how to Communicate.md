# Communication

### The Foundation: Think Like a Toddler

Remember how kids learn to talk? They don't start with grammar rules. They listen, they copy, and they aren't afraid to make mistakes. You need to adopt that mindset. Be curious, be patient with yourself, and celebrate the small wins.

**Your new mantra is: "Input first, then output."** You need to consume a lot of good communication before you can produce it.

### Step 1: Start with Listening (The Input)

Your brain needs raw material. You need to hear how people talk, tell stories, and explain things.

- **Podcasts:** Find a podcast on a topic you are genuinely interested in—gaming, cooking, history, cars, anything. The key is that you _want_ to listen. Don't worry about understanding every word. Just get used to the rhythm and flow of conversation.
    
- **Audiobooks:** Pick a simple, engaging book. Fiction is often great for this. Hearing a narrator express emotion and describe scenes is fantastic practice for your brain.
    
- **TED Talks:** These are gold. They are short, usually 10-18 minutes, and speakers are trained to be clear and engaging. They often have transcripts you can read along with.
    

**Your Goal:** Listen to something for at least 15-20 minutes every day. That’s it. Just listen.

### Step 2: Build Your Speaking Muscle (Private Practice)

The thought of speaking to people can be terrifying. So don't. Start by yourself.

- **Read Aloud:** Take a book, a news article, anything, and read it out loud in your room. This feels weird at first, but it is physically training your mouth, tongue, and vocal cords to form English words. You're building the muscle memory.
    
- **Narrate Your Life:** Seriously. When you're making coffee, describe what you're doing out loud. "Okay, I'm getting the mug from the cabinet. Now I'm putting the coffee grounds in the filter." It sounds silly, but you're practicing turning thoughts into spoken words, with zero pressure.
    
- **The "Shadowing" Technique:** Put on that podcast or TED Talk from Step 1. Listen to one sentence, pause it, and try to repeat it exactly as you heard it, copying the tone and rhythm. This is a powerful technique for improving your accent and flow.
    

**Your Goal:** Spend 5-10 minutes a day speaking out loud to yourself.

### Step 3: Learn to Express Yourself (Writing for Yourself)

Writing is thinking on paper. Since you never got to write long essays, your "expressing feelings" muscle is probably the one that needs the most gentle start. The best way to do this is with zero judgment.

- **Get a Journal:** This is your private space. No one else will see it. Every day, commit to writing just _three sentences_.
    
    - Sentence 1: "Today I felt..." (and name an emotion. If you can't find the word, describe it. "Today I felt like a buzzing in my chest.")
        
    - Sentence 2: "One thing I did was..." (Describe a simple action. "I walked to the store.")
        
    - Sentence 3: "One thing I thought about was..." (Anything. "I thought about what to have for dinner.")
        
- **Expand Your Emotional Vocabulary:** We often get stuck on "happy," "sad," "angry." Google a "Feelings Wheel." It will give you dozens of new words for emotions (like frustrated, content, anxious, proud, lonely). Try to use a new word in your journal each day.
    

**Your Goal:** Write your three sentences every single day. As it gets easier, you'll naturally start writing more.

### A Simple Starting Plan: The First Two Weeks

Don't overwhelm yourself. Try this for two weeks.

- **Every Day:**
    
    1. **Listen:** 15 minutes of a podcast or a TED Talk during your commute, while doing dishes, etc.
        
    2. **Write:** Write your three sentences in your journal before bed.
        
    3. **Speak:** Read one page of a book or a news article out loud.
        

That's it. It's maybe 30 minutes a day. After a couple of weeks, you will feel a difference. You will start to notice words and phrases more. Your mouth will feel more comfortable making the sounds. Your thoughts will feel a little less jumbled.

From there, you can move on to bigger things: having small conversations with cashiers, using an app like HelloTalk to chat with a language partner, or trying to write a full paragraph in your journal.
