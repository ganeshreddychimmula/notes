# Getting Started - DAS

2025-07-23 10:52
Seamus DM - Welcome! Please watchÂ [this video](https://www.loom.com/share/115df6c2e0c8472db17787eee2ebef20?sid=5b985f2f-2870-4840-af52-ea1630f4c835)Â and let me know here in this DM when complete. You'll have a series or work on your backlog as well waiting for you!

- Please remember that you will be responsible for keeping your hours up at the minimum, so if you find yourself working on something which doesn't correspond with a Task assigned to you, you'll need to create one for yourself. - I am responsible for keeping my hours atleast 20 hrs per week
- DAS Ventures - [@Ganesh](https://dasventures.slack.com/team/U097167B0TE), learn about this team by going to theÂ [reference section for Teams](https://airtable.com/app6duHw2djMIOYnh/pagDwJuSHlYBjBrEU?zgrRR)Â and selecting your new Team! You'll find information here like the Team's OKRs, your fellow team members, and any guidance the Teams has created for your onboarding, located in the New to the Team? section.

### Getting started with Airtable
- There is a tutorial at the end of each page, to get get familiarize with the page.
- If you feel, you can't complete a task by deadline, change deadline and don't forget to leave a comment mentioning a creator.
- Team Meetings - 
- Performance notes - can be used to write down things you want to remind yourself.

### Teams
#### `Operational` 
- I help users adopt to tools within the organization like Airtable.
- Help in making these systems and tools the people in the organization use more seamless and efficient.
- 
 âœ… **Team Purpose**
 
Youâ€™re part of a team that:
- **Designs & maintains systems** (like Airtable) to improve efficiency   
- **Builds integrations & automations** (e.g. connecting Airtable with Google Workspace)
- **Documents processes & provides technical support** to ensure long-term usability and scalability
 ðŸš« Not Your Scope
You **do not** handle:
- HR, Finance, Marketing, Relationships, Venture External Engagement (EvEx), or Website operations

 ðŸŽ¯ Team Objectives (OKRs)
 1. **Strengthen Change Management Processes**
	- Example: Helping teams adopt new tools (like Airtable views or automations)
	- You might be expected to assist with training, tool rollouts, or user feedback collection.
 2. **Assign Tool Ownership & Share Knowledge**
	- Example: Taking ownership of a tool feature (like forms, views, automations in Airtable)
	- Documenting and transferring that knowledge to others.
 3. **Drive Targeted Usability Improvements**
	- Example: Fixing friction points in high-priority tools
	- Could involve simplifying interfaces, building dashboards, or helping teams use Airtable more effectively.

### Tasks
- when you comment on a task, the creator gets looped in, a request raises on creator's side and becomes their responsibility to resolve.
- A **Task** is an assignment given to a specific person, either within your own team or across different teams. When you create a task, you are directly assigning responsibility for completing a defined piece of work to one individual. If that person is unavailable or not the ideal fit for the task, it may lead to inefficiencies or slowdowns. Tasks are generally used for well-defined pieces of work that do not require broad team collaboration or additional resources from other teams.

### Creating a Task Group
Create new -> New Task Group
- You can find created task groupsin `Mystuff -> Mywork`  
- Task Groups are larger undertakings that require multiple Tasks to complete.
	Defining a Task Group:
	- Limit task groups to last no larger than 2 months
	- Typically, Task Groups will have multiple Contributors collaborating on the Task Group
	- The task group will take on tasks that will, in their entirety complete the Task Group.
- You might and most probably would need to access to task groups during team meetings, so you can find one under there.
- In task group working interface, you can find all the details and options required to add meetings, other stuff.

### How to let people know  when you are going to miss a meeting?
- Manage and communicate your absences effectively with **'My Time Off'**. Here, you can:
	- Log time away from work, from extended leave to missing a single meeting.
	- Stay coordinated with your team and keep our operations running smoothly by updating your availability with a few clicks.
- If you're going to miss a meeting that has an agenda, like Plenary, indicate as much by _commenting_ on your name in the agenda with the reason for absence.
	- plenary -> agenda & notes -> ? (Deprecated I guess?)
	- My stuff -> My Time off -> select meeting and mark yourself absent
- If you're going to miss a meeting that does not have an agenda, indicate via RSVPing _no_ to the calendar event, ideally with a few words of explanation.
- If you're going to be away for a bit one to seven weeks, submit a _volunteer time off_ form so all know you're absent via your AirTable profile. It's also good practice here to post in the _comings and goings_ channel to broadcast your absence.
- If you're departing for either longer than 7 weeks or for an undetermined duration, please adjust your status to _taking a break_ here in AirTable. Please also post in the _comings and goings_ channel to broadcast your absence.


### New Request for another Team
- This form is used to communicate needs for other teams to consider.
- Requests here can be as small as a typo on our website to as large as creating an entirely new Team.
- You will be identified as the Creator of this request, and will be informed both as to whether the receiving team has accepted it onto their backlog, and or the progress made toward satisfying your need.
- A **Request** is a process we use to track and manage needs that require assistance from another team. **When you submit a request, you are seeking support, resources, or expertise that your team does not have.** The responsibility for addressing the request is shared across the team you are reaching out to, which allows them to assess their workload, prioritize effectively, and assign the most suitable person to handle the work. This structured approach helps minimize delays or bottlenecks, ensuring that the request is fulfilled efficiently.
- A **Task** is an assignment given to a specific person, either within your own team or across different teams. When you create a task, you are directly assigning responsibility for completing a defined piece of work to one individual. If that person is unavailable or not the ideal fit for the task, it may lead to inefficiencies or slowdowns. Tasks are generally used for well-defined pieces of work that do not require broad team collaboration or additional resources from other teams.
- **Track Your Request Status**
	Team Requests -> Requests
	To manage your team requests, click the button ==**Requests**== on the Team meetings Airtable interface
	Click the ==**Requests**== button to access a Kanban board displaying all team requests by status.
	- **Purpose**: Monitor the progress of your request.
	- **Instructions**: Go to **My Requests to Other Teams** to see all your submitted requests. Here, youâ€™ll find status updates, including whether your request has been:
	    - Approved or rejected (with comments if rejected)
	    - Converted to a task or task group (including status updates)
- ### Steps to Handle a Request - Flow[](#steps-to-handle-a-request-flow)
	1. **Understand the Request**
		- Click the ==**Consider request**== button.
		- Ask any clarifying questions in the comments section if needed.
		- Schedule and attach a meeting if necessary to discuss further and link the meeting using the **==+ Add meeting button==**
	2. **Manage the Request**
		- Decide whether to ==**Convert to Task**== or ==**Convert to Task Group**==. Alternatively, you can reject the request if it is not feasible.
		- To satisfy the request, create a new task or task group. The status will be automatically updated, and the linked task or task group will be visible in this section.
		- Complete all the necessary data for the new task or task group.  
	3. **Link to Existing Tasks (If Applicable)**
		- If this request is related to an existing task or task group, connect it by clicking **Add record**.
	4. **Reject the Request (If Necessary)**
		- Include an explanation comment in the comments section before rejecting.
		- Tag the request creator using `@username` to notify them about the rejection.
		- Click the **Reject Request** button.
	5. **Track the Resultant Task/Group**
		- Once the request is processed, you can view the status under **Resultant Task/Group**.

Error Group:
- missing data
- some tasks are overdue
- Conflicting dates
### I need something to do
-  Option 3: Take on/join an existing Task Group
- Add as volunteer/ contributor, let others know.
- Join a team
	- 

### Plenary
- mark yourself present
- to take notes - select topic under topics yet to be covered. -> after that mark discussed

**Anytime you'll be away, it's also super-helpful to add a _slack status_ too! Please adjust your _status_ to Something representative and include the date you plan to return.**



### Questions
- what can I add under tasks ?
- What is considered self-task done? or time spent?
- If I research something for some work, is that time spen t?
- plenary - all person meeting that happens every 2 weeks.
	- Mark yourself present.
- what is action items here ?![[Pasted image 20250724193937.png]]
- Why is there no structured path, Like a Course, instead of assigning todo tasks.
	-  Would boost confidence and save time.
