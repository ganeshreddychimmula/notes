# Why Frontend is harder than backend
https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1jrminn/is_frontend_more_tedious_than_backend/

Front end is tedious because there's a lot going on. There's styling, responsiveness, error handling, loading states, communication with backend, state management, defensiveness (knowing as little as possible), etc. like art, it's easy to make but hard to make it look good


Modern front end is almost always full stack because if you didn't build your backend apis then you're cursing the guy who did. Nowadays frontend should mean full stack and backend means "I'm not and will never be building a UI"

`Anyone who says CSS is easy never had to do complex task with it change my mind.`

I don't generally get upset over things I read online - except when people say that "front-end development is easy".  
  
Because if you say it is, you better be an expert in:  
  
→ Accessibility  
→ Semantic HTML
→ Browser / device support - adaptable, responsive website 
→ Writing maintainable CSS  
→ JavaScript and frameworks  
→ Search Engine Optimization
  
... and a million other things.  
  
Of course you can learn the basics of these topics. But to really master them all will take YEARS of practice and experience
