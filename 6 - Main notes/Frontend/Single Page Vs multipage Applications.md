# Single Page Vs multipage Applications
https://reactrouter.com/6.30.1/start/overview#client-side-routing

## 🧠 What is a SPA (Single Page Application)?

A **SPA** loads a single HTML page and updates the content dynamically via **JavaScript** (usually React, Angular, Vue) **without reloading the entire page**.

### ✅ Examples:

- Gmail
    
- Facebook
    
- Twitter
    
- Trello

## 🧠 What is an MPA (Multi-Page Application)?

An **MPA** loads a **new HTML page from the server for each route** or URL. Every time the user navigates, the browser **requests a new page**.

### ✅ Examples:

- Amazon
    
- Wikipedia
    
- Government websites
    
- Traditional e-commerce platforms

## 🔍 Side-by-Side Comparison

|Feature|SPA|MPA|
|---|---|---|
|**Page Reloads**|❌ No (uses client-side routing)|✅ Yes (each navigation hits server)|
|**Speed (After Load)**|⚡ Fast (content swaps dynamically)|🐢 Slower (full page reload)|
|**Initial Load Time**|🐢 Slower (loads JS bundle upfront)|⚡ Faster (only necessary HTML)|
|**SEO Support**|❌ Limited (needs extra setup like SSR)|✅ Great (HTML served directly)|
|**Development Stack**|JS-heavy (React, Angular, etc.)|Server + HTML-based (PHP, Django)|
|**Caching**|🧠 App shell caching possible|✅ Each page can be cached separately|
|**Routing**|Handled by JS router|Handled by server|
|**User Experience**|Seamless, app-like feel|Traditional web navigation|

## ✅ When to Use SPA

- You want an **app-like feel**
    
- Complex interactions (dashboards, chat apps)
    
- Fewer pages with dynamic data
    
- You're okay with handling SEO manually (e.g., using SSR like Next.js)
    

---

## ✅ When to Use MPA

- Large websites with many static pages
    
- Strong **SEO requirements** (e.g. blogs, product listings)
    
- Simpler or traditional server-rendered workflows
    
- Each page can be independently served

## 🔄 Hybrid Approach

**Frameworks like Next.js and Nuxt.js** offer a hybrid:  
✅ SPA experience with SSR or static generation for SEO.
