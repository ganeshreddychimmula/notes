# Why GET is preferred over the POST method
> You are correct in distinguishing between GET and POST requests, although the terms "basic repeatable" and "less common" can be further refined based on the sources to better capture their core functionalities and implications.

Here's a more precise understanding of their uses:

- **HTTP GET Requests**:
    
    - **Purpose**: The GET method is primarily used to **retrieve data from the server**. It fetches resources like HTML documents, images (e.g., `kuva.png`), CSS stylesheets (e.g., `main.css`), and JSON data (e.g., `data.json`).
    - **Idempotence**: A key characteristic of GET requests is that they should be **idempotent**, meaning that making the same request multiple times will have the **same effect as making it once**. It does not cause any changes to the server's state.
    - **Repeatability/Caching**: Because they are designed for retrieval and do not alter server state, GET requests are **eligible for caching**, which can save bandwidth and improve performance. This makes them suitable for "repeatable tasks" where you just need to fetch the same data again.
    - **URL Addressability**: GET requests can be directly addressed via the URL, making them **bookmarkable and shareable**.
    - **Body (Optional)**: GET requests **do not require a request body** because they are not sending complex information to the server to modify or create a resource.
- **HTTP POST Requests**:
    
    - **Purpose**: The POST method is used when **submitting data to the server**, typically to **create or update a resource**. This involves sending data that will cause a **change in the server's state**.
    - **Consequential Nature**: Submitting a form, uploading a file, posting a message to a forum, or completing an online shopping transaction are all examples where POST is used because these actions have a "consequential" impact by modifying data on the server.
    - **Data Transmission**: Data is sent as the **body of the POST request**. This is distinct from GET, where data might appear in the URL query parameters. Sending data in the body is generally preferred for sensitive or large amounts of data, as it's not exposed directly in the URL.
    - **"Less Common" Nuance**: While POST is used for actions that change server state (which might be less frequent than simply fetching pages in some browsing sessions), for applications like social media or e-commerce, **POST requests are very common** for user interactions (e.g., posting comments, making purchases). So, it's not necessarily about being "less common" overall, but rather about their role in modifying server resources versus mere retrieval.
    - **Server Response**: After a POST request, the server often responds with an HTTP status code, such as `302 Found` (URL redirect) in traditional web applications, asking the browser to perform a new GET request to update the page. In modern Single-Page Applications (SPAs), the server might respond with `201 Created` without requiring a page reload, and JavaScript handles the update.
