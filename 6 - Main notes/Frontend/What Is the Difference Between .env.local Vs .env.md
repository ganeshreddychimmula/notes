# What Is the Difference Between .env.local Vs .env
https://dxarslan.com/development/env-local-vs-env-key-differences/

- These files are called Environment files
- Environment configuration is a key aspect of software development, especially when handling secrets like [API keys](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/api-key/#:~:text=An%20API%20key%20is%20an,monetize%20your%20APIs%20more%20efficiently.), database credentials, or other sensitive information.


## .env vs .env.local: Key Differences

- **Global vs Local Scope**: `.env` is intended for general application-wide settings that are shared across environments. In contrast, `.env.local` is used for settings that are unique to your local machine, making it ideal for local testing and development without affecting other team members.
- **Environment-Specific Configuration**: The `.env` file typically contains default values that could be applied across multiple environments like development, staging, and production. On the other hand, `.env.local` overrides these values specifically for local development, giving you a safer way to experiment.
- **Version Control Practices**: `.env` files are often included in version control (if no sensitive data is stored), providing a consistent configuration. However, `.env.local` files are usually ignored by Git (`.gitignore`) to keep sensitive or machine-specific information private.

## **File** Priority **in Different Environments**

- **Development Environment (**`**npm start**`**)**:
    - `.env.development.local`
    - `.env.local`
    - `.env.development`
    - `.env`
- **Production Environment (**`**npm run build**`**)**:
    
    - - `.env.production.local`
	- `.env.local`
	- `.env.production`
    - `.env`

## **Best** Practices **for Using .env Files**

1. **Keep Secrets Out of Repositories**: Make sure any sensitive data remains in local files like `.env.local` that are ignored by version control.
2. **Use Defaults in .env**: Define default values that work across different stages of your project lifecycle, but leave specific adjustments to local files.
3. **Override Locally When Needed**: `.env.local` helps override values without worrying about changing core application settings—perfect for debugging or local testing.
4. **Integrate with Hosting Services**: When deploying to platforms like Vercel, manage your environment variables through the dashboard and use `.env.local` for local overrides, if necessary. This ensures your deployment environments stay consistent while allowing local flexibility.
5. **Use NEXT_PUBLIC_ Prefix for Browser Variables**: Only expose environment variables to the browser when necessary by using the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix. This keeps sensitive data secure while allowing public-facing variables to be accessible.
6. **Loading Variables Outside Runtime**: Use `@next/env` to load environment variables outside of the runtime for use in configuration files or testing environments.

## How to access environment variables

You can access the variables defined in environmental files in a few different ways, depending on the programming language and framework you're using. Generally, you'll use a library or built-in functions to load and parse the `.env` file, which then makes the variables available in your code.

### Using a Library

Many programming languages have dedicated libraries for handling `.env` files. These libraries typically provide a simple way to load the file and access the variables as if they were system environment variables. For example, in **Python**, you can use the `python-dotenv` library.

Python

```
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

my_variable = os.getenv("MY_VARIABLE")
```

Similarly, in **Node.js**, you can use the `dotenv` package.

JavaScript

```
require('dotenv').config()

const myVariable = process.env.MY_VARIABLE;
```

### Framework-Specific Methods

Some frameworks have built-in support for `.env` files, so you may not need an external library. For example, in **Vite**, you can access environment variables using `import.meta.env`.

JavaScript

```
const myVariable = import.meta.env.VITE_MY_VARIABLE;
```

Note that in Vite, you need to prefix your variables with `VITE_` to expose them to the client-side code.

### Shell Scripting

In a shell script, you can use the `source` command to load the variables from a `.env` file into the current shell session.

Bash

```
source .env
echo $MY_VARIABLE
```

### Important Considerations

- **Security:** Be careful not to commit your `.env` files to version control, as they may contain sensitive information like API keys and database passwords. Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent this.
    
- **Naming Conventions:** It's a common convention to use all uppercase letters for environment variable names, with words separated by underscores (e.g., `DATABASE_URL`).
    
- **Framework and Language Documentation:** Always check the documentation for your specific framework or language to see the recommended way to handle environment variables.
