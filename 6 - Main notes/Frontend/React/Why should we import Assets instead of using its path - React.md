# Why should we import Assets instead of using its path - React
Great question Importing assets like:

```jsx
import banner from '../assets/banner.jpg';
```

has **multiple benefits**, especially when using modern build tools like **Vite** or **Webpack** (used under the hood in most React projects).

---

## âœ… Why Should You Import Assets This Way?

---

### ðŸ”¹ 1. **Ensures asset is bundled and optimized**

- When you import an image from `src`, tools like Vite/Webpack will:
    
    - Compress it
        
    - Rename it (hash-based filename like `banner.abc123.jpg`)
        
    - Include it in your production build
        

âœ… This avoids broken image links and ensures your app loads fast.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2. **Automatic Path Resolution**

You donâ€™t have to worry about exact public URLs.

```jsx
<img src={banner} alt="Banner" />
```

React (via Vite/Webpack) figures out the correct path during build.

> ðŸ“¦ Even if the file moves during deployment, the `import` path will still work.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 3. **Prevents 404 errors in production**

If you use `src="/banner.jpg"` and forget to put the image in `public/`, you'll get a 404.

When importing via `import`, the bundler guarantees the file **exists** and gets included in the build output.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 4. **Enables code splitting (for large assets)**

Imported assets can be:

- Lazy-loaded
    
- Included **only where needed**
    
- Excluded from components that donâ€™t use them
    

This reduces your app's initial load time.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 5. **Type safety and static analysis**

Tools like TypeScript or ESLint can catch:

- Missing asset imports
    
- Invalid paths
    
- Unused files
    

---

## ðŸ”„ Compare:

| Method                      | Pros                                    | Cons                           |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `import banner from ...`    | Optimized, safe, and build-aware        | Only works for files in `src/` |
| `<img src="/banner.jpg" />` | Direct path, simple for `public/` files | No bundling, no optimization   |

---

## âœ… TL;DR

> **Import assets** using `import ... from ...` when:

- The file is in `src/`
    
- You want React to manage it
    
- You care about performance and reliability
    

Use direct paths (`/logo.png`) **only for files in `public/`**.
