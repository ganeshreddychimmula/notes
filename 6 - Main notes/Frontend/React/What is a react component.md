# What is a react component
- A function that returns a React Elements
- A React Element is react version of what we see in the DOM
- It is like the React version of HTML Element.
- Because JSX Looks very similar to HTML elements we call them React element. 
- However, the main difference is the JSX Syntax  are first converted to calls to `React.createReact` and then `createReact` function turns them into JavaScript object which then interpreted by react and then turned to DOM nodes
