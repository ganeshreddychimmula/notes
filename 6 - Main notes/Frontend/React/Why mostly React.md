# Why do we need React
It's Composable!
- Can create easily reusable and interchangeable `pieces of web` that can be combined in various ways to create complex systems
It's Declarative!
- Can Lean on the library to handle manual, tedious tasks that we otherwise would have to worry about ourselves.
- Declarative meaning: `What should be done`
	- Just tell me what needs to be happen, and I'll worry about how to do it?

		- here, we just tell to react that we need this h1 and ask it to figure out how it will assign stuff.
- imperative: Opposite of Declarative
	- Describe me every step on how to do something.

### When to Opt for React?
>when a ==page changes frequently and drastically because of changes in either internal (state) or external (database, API, etc.) data.==  [^1] 

- At any point, your friends could tweet or like your tweet, and you want to see it right away. And you want to be able to shift from reading tweets to replying, liking, or tweeting at any moment without things slowing down or feeling disjointed.
- With vanilla JS, it would be quite messy and you need to manually consider lot of constantly updating, changing parts of application.
