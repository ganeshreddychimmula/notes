# What does Full Stack Web development mean?
Full stack is a buzzword that everyone talks about, but no one knows what it means. Or at least, there is no agreed-upon definition for the term.

Practically all web applications have (at least) two "layers": the browser, being closer to the end-user, is the top layer, and the server the bottom one. There is often also a database layer below the server. We can therefore think of the ==**_architecture_ of a web application as a _stack_ of layers.**==

The browser is the frontend, and the JavaScript that runs on the browser is the frontend code. The server on the other hand is the backend.

Oftentimes, full-stack developers must also have enough configuration and administration skills to operate their applications, for example, in the cloud.

Full-stack web development is challenging in many ways. Things are happening in many places at once, and debugging is quite a bit harder than with regular desktop applications. JavaScript does not always work as you'd expect it to (compared to many other languages), and the asynchronous way its runtime environments work causes all sorts of challenges. Communicating on the web requires knowledge of the HTTP protocol. One must also handle databases and server administration and configuration. It would also be good to know enough CSS to make applications at least somewhat presentable.
