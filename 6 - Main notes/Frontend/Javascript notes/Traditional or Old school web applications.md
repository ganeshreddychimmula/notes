# Traditional or Old school web applications
Traditional or **old-school web applications** operate on a principle where the **browser is considered "dumb"** and primarily fetches HTML data from the server. In this model, **all application logic resides on the server**.

Here's a breakdown of their characteristics:

- **HTML Fetching**: When a user accesses a page in a traditional web application, the browser sends an HTTP GET request to the server to **fetch the HTML document**. This HTML document dictates the structure and textual content of the page.
- **Server-Side Logic**: The server is responsible for forming this HTML document. This document can be:
    - A **static text file** saved directly on the server.
    - **Formed dynamically** by the server according to the application's code, potentially using data from a database. The example application's homepage, for instance, forms its HTML dynamically to include the number of created notes. This dynamic generation means that elements like `noteCount` are replaced by current values before the HTML is sent.
- **Browser's Role**: The browser's main function is to **render the HTML data** it receives from the server. It does not perform complex application logic itself.
- **Server Technologies**: Servers for traditional web applications can be created using various technologies like **Java Spring, Python Flask, or Ruby on Rails**. The example application in the sources uses the Express library with Node.js for its web server.
- **Comparison to Modern Approaches**: Before the AJAX era (around 2005), all web pages functioned like traditional web applications, with all displayed data being fetched as part of the HTML code generated by the server. The homepage of the example application demonstrates this traditional approach. Later advancements, like AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) and Single-Page Applications (SPAs), emerged to allow content to be fetched and manipulated on the page using JavaScript without needing to rerender the entire page. However, even in applications using some AJAX, actions like form submissions might still revert to the traditional method of sending data and relying on server redirects to reload the page.
