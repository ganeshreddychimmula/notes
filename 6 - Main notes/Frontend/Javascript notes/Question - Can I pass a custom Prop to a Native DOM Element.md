# Question - Can I pass a custom Prop to a Native DOM Element

Great question! The short answer is:

> ‚ùå **No**, you generally should **not pass custom props** like `blahblahblah={true}` to native DOM elements like `<div>` ‚Äî because **the browser doesn't know what to do with them**. But, you can in literal sense.


---

## üß† Why Not?

When you do this:

```jsx
<div blahblahblah={true}>Hello</div>
```

React tries to render this as real HTML:

```html
<div blahblahblah="true">Hello</div>
```

But:

- `blahblahblah` is **not a valid HTML attribute**
    
- This can trigger **warnings** in the console
    
- Or even cause unexpected behavior in the browser
    

> ‚ö†Ô∏è React will warn you: ‚ÄúReceived unknown prop `blahblahblah` on a DOM element.‚Äù

## ‚úÖ So when _can_ I use custom props?

You **can** use any custom prop **on your own components**, not on native elements.

### ‚úÖ Example: Valid usage on a custom component

```jsx
function FancyBox({ blahblahblah }) {
  return <div>{blahblahblah ? "Yup!" : "Nope!"}</div>;
}

// Usage:
<FancyBox blahblahblah={true} />
```

> ‚úÖ This is totally fine because React knows to **pass `blahblahblah` into your component**, not into the DOM.

---

## üß© If You Still Want to Pass Data to DOM‚Ä¶

Use **`data-*` attributes** ‚Äî which are valid custom HTML attributes:

```jsx
<div data-blahblahblah="true">Hello</div>
```

This works safely and is designed for embedding custom data.

## ‚úÖ TL;DR

| Situation                          | Allowed? | Why                           |
| ---------------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------- |
| `<div blahblahblah={true} />`      | ‚ùå No     | Invalid HTML, React will warn |
| `<FancyBox blahblahblah={true} />` | ‚úÖ Yes    | It's your component           |
| `<div data-blahblahblah="true" />` | ‚úÖ Yes    | `data-*` is valid HTML        |
