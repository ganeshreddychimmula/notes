# Event delegation - JavaScript

### üß† **What is Event Delegation? 

> **Event Delegation** is a pattern where instead of adding event listeners to many individual child elements, you add **one event listener to a common parent** and **use `event.target` to detect which child triggered the event.**

---

### üì¶ Analogy: The Waiter

Imagine you're at a restaurant where:

- Each table has **10 buttons** for ordering (starter, main, dessert...).
    
- You could assign **1 waiter per button** (bad idea üí∏)
    
- Instead, you assign **one smart waiter per table** üß†. He listens to **all clicks**, then looks at **which button was clicked**.
    

This is **event delegation**.

---

### üß™ **Example Without Delegation (Bad)**

```js
const buttons = document.querySelectorAll('button');

buttons.forEach(btn => {
  btn.addEventListener('click', () => {
    console.log('Button clicked:', btn.textContent);
  });
});
```

- ‚úÖ Works
    
- ‚ùå Not scalable if there are 100s or dynamic buttons
    

---

### ‚úÖ **Example With Event Delegation (Better)**

```html
<ul id="menu">
  <li>Home</li>
  <li>About</li>
  <li>Contact</li>
</ul>
```

```js
document.getElementById("menu").addEventListener("click", function (e) {
  if (e.target.tagName === "LI") {
    console.log("Clicked:", e.target.textContent);
  }
});
```

- Only one event listener on `#menu`
    
- Even if new `<li>` elements are added dynamically, this still works!
    

---

### üîÑ **How It Works (Under the Hood)**

1. When an event is triggered on a child (e.g., a `<li>`),
    
2. It **bubbles up** the DOM (unless stopped),
    
3. You catch it on the parent (e.g., `<ul>`),
    
4. Then use `event.target` to find **which child was clicked**.

### üß† Benefits of Event Delegation

|‚úÖ Benefit|üß† Explanation|
|---|---|
|Performance|Fewer event listeners = faster, less memory usage|
|Works with dynamic DOM|Even elements added later will trigger the event|
|Cleaner code|Easier to manage, especially in lists or tables|

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Gotchas

- Events like `blur`, `focus`, `mouseenter`, `mouseleave` **don‚Äôt bubble**, so can't be delegated easily.
    
- Always **check `event.target`** to filter clicks to the intended child elements.
    

---

### üìå Summary

> **Event Delegation = One parent listener + Smart filtering of events from child elements**

‚úÖ Use it for:

- Lists (menus, comments, notifications)
    
- Tables
    
- Dynamically added buttons/fields
