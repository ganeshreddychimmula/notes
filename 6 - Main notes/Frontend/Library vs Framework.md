# Library vs Framework
| Library                                               | Framework                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Collection of reusable Code                           | Predetermined architechture - you follow speccifed path of development |
| reduce the need to write complex/ things from scratch | you work within the boundaries set by the framework                    |
| you can control how and when its used with boundaries | There are "right" and "wrong" ways to use it.                          |
### Library:
- Collection of pre written code modules to solve a specific task
- I get to decide when and where to use it.
- It is like building Cooking set with all the items needed for it. You can decide how you wanted to cook. You can decide the quantities you can use and when to use.
- Or like a tools when building a house. You can build however you want to build.
- You need to still build and plan everything by yourself, you need to be careful how you structure and plan for complex projects.
**Key Characteristics:**
- **Control:** You maintain control over the application's flow or structure.
- **Selective Use:** You only use the parts of the library you need.
- **Flexibility:** You have more freedom in how you structure your code.
- **Examples:** jQuery (for DOM manipulation in web development), Axios (for making HTTP requests), NumPy (for numerical computing in Python).
### Framework
- It provides predefined structure and set of rules/conventions to follow to build something.
- It provides a template or pre existing skeletal structure to build on.
- place. You have to follow the blueprint's layout for rooms, plumbing, and electrical wiring, but you can choose the specific paint colors, furniture, and decorations.
- It provides a reliable structure to build on, so you can focus on other things.
- In complex projects, this would be very helpful as it provides a stable base, so don't need to track back major changes or afraid entire project gets overwhelmed with wrong planning.
**Key Characteristics:**

- **Inversion of Control (IoC):** The framework controls the application's flow, calling your code when it needs to. You "fill in the blanks" or implement specific methods that the framework expects.
- **Structure:** It provides a skeletal structure for your application.
- **Convention over Configuration:** Often relies on conventions to reduce the amount of configuration you need to do.
- **Opinionated:** Frameworks often have strong opinions on how things should be done, which can speed up development but also limit flexibility.
- **Examples:** React (while often called a library, it has strong framework-like characteristics in its ecosystem and component-based approach), Angular, Vue.js (for front-end web development), Ruby on Rails, Django (for back-end web development).

| Feature               | Library                               | Framework                                |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------- |
| **Control**           | You call the library                  | The framework calls your code (IoC)      |
| **Structure**         | No inherent structure for your app    | Provides a predefined structure          |
| **Flexibility**       | High                                  | Moderate to low (within its conventions) |
| **Learning Curve**    | Generally lower                       | Generally higher                         |
| **Development Speed** | Can be slower initially (more manual) | Can be faster once learned (scaffolding) |
| **Opinionated**       | Less so                               | More so                                  |
| **Scope**             | Specific tasks or functionalities     | Entire application architecture          |

**When to choose which?**

- **Choose a Library when:**
    - You need a specific functionality and want to use it in already working project without a need for whole new structure.
    - You want maximum control over your application's architecture.
    - You're building a smaller application or adding features to an existing one.
- **Choose a Framework when:**
    - You're starting a new project and want a clear, established structure to build upon.
    - You want to accelerate development by leveraging pre-built components and conventions.
    - You're building a larger, more complex application that benefits from a consistent architecture.
In essence, a library is a tool you use, while a framework is a foundation you build upon.
