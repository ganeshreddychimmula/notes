# Still into web dev — but is it worth diving back into math and learning AI to build smarter apps
https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/1lr8qgu/still_into_web_dev_but_is_it_worth_diving_back/

Lately, I’ve been thinking about going further—revisiting math (which I still love) and learning some **AI**, so I can build smarter, more powerful web applications in the future. The idea of **combining AI with web development** really excites me.

But I’m unsure where to start. Is this a realistic or valuable path to take? Has anyone else gone from web dev into math/AI, or tried to merge the two? I'd love to hear your **thoughts** or **advice** on how to move forward.

Sol: 
Yeah, it’s not just realistic but it’s probably one of the most valuable pivots you can make right now. Web dev gives you the tools to deploy fast; AI gives you the intelligence layer. **Marry the two**, and you’re building intelligent apps that people actually want to use. Since you already love math, the learning curve won’t feel like a grind just reframe it as solving real-world problems instead of chasing abstract theory. Start with **Kaggle not to win competitions, but to get hands-on with clean, structured simple notebooks.** Then move to **Hugging Face where you can plug in powerful language models into your apps without training** anything from scratch. Want something more guided?  **ProjectPro** has legit enterprise-grade end-to-end projects think real data pipelines,AI agents, model deployment, and full-stack ML workflows built specifically for people who want to build, not just theorize. You don’t need to master deep learning on day one. Start small: a smart search bar, a recommendation widget, maybe a chatbot trained on your docs. The path forward isn’t learning everything it’s deploying small, intelligent features and leveling up with each one. You’re not late. You’re actually right on time.
