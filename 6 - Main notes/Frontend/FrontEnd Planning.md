# React Planning

### Goal:
- Goal is to not only learn React, Typescript, NextJS, Tailwind CSS, Redux. I want it to make it a deployable app. I want to at least know howLearn  to deploy an application. Want to have basic knowledge of Backend, database and connect the frontend and backend. 
- Which is better [Full Stack IO](https://fullstackopen.com/en/about) vs [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn-react-c0e)
- I don't want to just focus on Learning react. Full Stack Open is better for learning full meals.

### Order

**I will be learning  ``React, Typescript -> Tailwind CSS -> Advanced React, React Router  Redux, -> NextJS`` in the same order**

1. [x] React (Core Concepts) - 
	- JSX, components, props, state
	- UseState, useEffect, useRef, conditional rendering
	- Work in the react projects
2. Tailwind CSS (Quick styling with components)
	- Learn how to style without writing custom CSS:
	- Great for building UIs fast
	- Popular in modern frontend projects
	- No need to memorize `className="my-custom-style"` stuff
	- üß† Easy to pick up alongside React UI building.
3. TypeScript with React (Start early alongside UI work) : Learn how to type props, state, and component functions:
	- Makes you write better, safer code
	- Gives confidence as your app grows
	- üõ†Ô∏è Combine this with small React apps (don‚Äôt delay TS too much ‚Äî learn it side-by-side once you're comfy with JS).
4. Advanced React + React Router + Redux
	- `useReducer`, `useContext`, custom hooks
	- `React Router` (for client-side navigation)
	- `Redux` (for global state in large apps)
	- Possibly `React Query` (if you work with async data)
	- üõ†Ô∏è Build a realistic app with nested routes, protected pages, and shared state (e.g., e-commerce, dashboard, etc.)
5. Next.js (Full-stack React Framework)
	- File-based routing (replaces React Router)
	- SSR, SSG, API routes
	- Built-in TypeScript + Tailwind support
	- SEO optimization
	- üß† You'll appreciate Next.js **much more** after doing React + Redux ‚Äî you'll understand why it solves certain problems.

	
## üß† Strategy:

- **Use Scrimba React for fast, interactive React + TypeScript project building** (great for Month 1).
    
- **Jump into Full Stack Open selectively**:
    
    - Use it for backend (Node.js), Redux, CI/CD, testing in Month 1‚Äì2.
        
    - You‚Äôll revisit its backend practices when building ML/AI backends later in Python.

## üìÖ Integrated Plan (First 6 Weeks)

### ‚úÖ Week 1‚Äì2: React + TypeScript Fundamentals (Scrimba)

**Goal**: Build your first React + TS apps and become frontend-confident.

**Do:**

- [x] Scrimba React Course:
    
    - Modules: `Intro to React`, `JSX`, `Props`, `State`, `Conditional Rendering`
    - JSX, components, props, state
	- UseState, useEffect, useRef, conditional rendering

**Parallel from Full Stack Open (optional):**

- Read **Part 0: Web App Basics** for HTML/CSS/JS refresher
    
- Skim **Part 1: Intro to React** if you want a text-based complement

- [x] Work on projects provided in React Scrimba course
    
- Add TypeScript module from Scrimba (optional but recommended)
    

---

### ‚úÖ Week 3: Routing, Tailwind, State Management

**Goal**: Implement routing and global state for capstone UI (Scrimba + FSO).

**Do:**

	- Scrimba React Modules:
    
    - `React Router`, `Forms`, `useEffect`, `Context`
        
    - Build a small e-commerce front (product cards, detail pages)
        
- Add Tailwind CSS manually (custom setup)  
    ‚Üí Use: [Tailwind + Vite + React Setup Guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite)
    

**From Full Stack Open:**

- Jump to **Part 6: Redux** ‚Äî follow just Redux intro and setup with your project
    
    - Integrate Redux Toolkit into your project with cart/user state
        

---

### ‚úÖ Week 4: Capstone Project + Next.js + Deployment

**Goal**: Finalize a fully styled, deployed frontend app with basic API mocking.

**Do:**

- Finalize your Capstone Project using:
    
    - React + TypeScript
        
    - Tailwind CSS
        
    - React Router / Redux
        
- Convert the app to Next.js (if comfortable)
    
    - Or follow **Scrimba‚Äôs Next.js or Full Stack Open's Part 12 (bonus)**
        
- Deploy with Vercel
    
- Create a polished GitHub README
