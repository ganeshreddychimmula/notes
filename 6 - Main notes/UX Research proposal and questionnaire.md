# SAN Venture Reporting Dashboard UX Research

## 1.     Problem Statement

The current reporting process at SAN relies on MyCase Pro and manual spreadsheets. Staff must export two separate data files, manually match them by client names, and compile reports for funders. This workflow is time-consuming, prone to errors, and frustrating for staff who need accurate, timely, and filterable reports. Our goal is to deeply understand this workflow, document the pain points, and provide recommendations for a more efficient dashboard solution that meets both staff and funder needs.

## 2.     Major Research Questions

Ø  What are the exact steps staff follow today when generating a report?

Ø  What makes the process slow—loading time, manual matching, or multitasking?

Ø  Where do errors most often occur, and how do staff currently fix them?

Ø  How often are reports generated, and what turnaround times are acceptable?

Ø  Which filters, formats, and past-date options are essential for staff and funders?

Ø  How much time and effort could be saved with a streamlined dashboard?

## 3.     Methods

To answer these questions, I will build on the work of the previous team. My next steps are:

1.       Conduct my own heuristic evaluation and cognitive walkthrough of MyCase reporting.

2.        Interview Brenna and other staff to capture step-by-step workflows, pain points, and expectations.

3.       Run task-based usability sessions where staff complete real reporting tasks while I measure time, errors, and rework.

4.       Collect baseline performance metrics to compare with future dashboard improvements.

## 4. Results and Recommendations

From this research, I will produce:

Ø  A service blueprint of the current reporting workflow.

Ø  Baseline metrics (time-on-task, error rates, rework rates).

Ø  A prioritized list of pain points and opportunities.

Ø  Recommendations for product manager, including data model improvements (e.g., unique IDs), as-of date reporting, unified filters, one-click exports, and training/onboarding support.

## ***Interview Guide: Brenna****

**Warm-up:**

1.       Can you tell me about your role and how reporting fits into your weekly or monthly work?

2.       Who uses your reports, and in what format?

3.       What types of data do you usually include in your reports?

**Workflow:**

4.       Please Walk me through your last report step by step.

5.       Which exports do you run, and what file formats?

6.        How do you match spreadsheets, and what tools do you use?

7.       How do you check for errors before submitting a report?

**Frequency & Time:**

8.       How often do you generate reports?

9.       How long does it take on average?

10.   What is considered an acceptable turnaround time?

**Pain Points:**

11.   Where exactly does the process feel frustrating?

12.   What parts are most prone to errors?

13.   How much rework do you usually have to do?

**Filters & Historical Reporting:**

14.   What filters do you use most often?

15.   Do you ever need to generate reports from a specific past date?

16.   Are there any archival rules or time limits for how far back you need reports?

**Outputs & Trust:**

17.   What should the final deliverable look like?

18.   Which export formats would be most useful (Excel, CSV, PDF)?

19.   What would make you immediately trust a new dashboard tool?

**Close:**

20.   Is there anything I haven’t asked that regularly causes problems?

21.   Would you be open to a follow-up screen-share session of a real report?

22.   Is there someone we can speak with for further analysis of the pain points and the new dashboard to look like?

23.   Finally, I would like to access MyCase to conduct a heuristic evaluation myself. Since I have already signed the NDA, could you please grant me access?

**Note:** I would appreciate it if we could record the meeting so that I can analyze the data from our discussion. I will ask Brenna about this at the start of our meeting. If not possible I will be taking notes.
