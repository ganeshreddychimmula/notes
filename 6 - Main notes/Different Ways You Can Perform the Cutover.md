# Different Ways I Can Perform the Cutover

There are several standard strategies for managing a cutover, each with its own risks and benefits.

#### 1. The "Big Bang" Cutover (All at Once)

This is the most straightforward but also the highest-risk approach.

- **What it is:** You pick a specific date and time (e.g., 5:00 PM on a Friday) to switch the entire organization from Airtable to Coda at the same time.
    
- **How it works:**
    
    1. **Announce a Freeze:** Communicate to all users that at 5 PM on Friday, Airtable will become read-only.
        
    2. **Perform Final Migration:** Over the weekend, you perform the final export of all data from Airtable and import it into Coda.
        
    3. **Test & Verify:** You frantically test to make sure everything works as expected.
        
    4. **Go-Live:** On Monday morning, you send an announcement with the link to the new Coda system and instructions.
        
- **Pros:**
    
    - It's fast and decisive.
        
    - You don't have to manage two systems running at the same time.
        
- **Cons:**
    
    - **Extremely high risk.** If anything goes wrong during the migration or testing over the weekend (a broken integration, corrupted data), you have a major crisis on Monday morning with no working system.
        
    - Puts immense pressure on you as the solo developer.
        

#### 2. The Phased Cutover (By Module or Team)

This is a more cautious, lower-risk approach that breaks the migration into smaller pieces.

- **What it is:** You migrate the organization gradually, either one function at a time or one team at a time.
    
- **How it works (by team):**
    
    1. **Pilot Group:** You move only your 5-person Operations team to Coda first.
        
    2. **Run in Parallel:** The rest of the organization continues using Airtable while your pilot team tests everything in Coda.
        
    3. **Fix & Stabilize:** You work closely with the pilot team to fix bugs and smooth out the process.
        
    4. **Expand Rollout:** Once the system is stable for the Ops team, you migrate the next team (e.g., Fundraising), and so on, until everyone is on Coda.
        
- **Pros:**
    
    - **Much lower risk.** Problems are contained within a small group of users.
        
    - Allows you to learn and improve the system based on feedback from the pilot group.
        
    - Less overwhelming for you and the users.
        
- **Cons:**
    
    - Takes much longer to complete the full migration.
        
    - Can create temporary complexity (e.g., "If you're on the Ops team, do X in Coda; everyone else, do it in Airtable").
        

#### 3. The Parallel Run Cutover

This is the safest but often least practical approach due to the burden on users.

- **What it is:** For a set period (e.g., two weeks), the entire organization runs _both_ systems simultaneously.
    
- **How it works:**
    
    1. You launch the Coda system but keep Airtable fully active.
        
    2. You instruct all users that for the next two weeks, they must enter all data into _both_ Airtable and Coda.
        
    3. **Validate:** At the end of the period, you compare the data in both systems. If they match and Coda is working well, you are confident it's ready.
        
    4. **Go-Live:** You officially decommission Airtable.
        
- **Pros:**
    
    - The safest method, as you have a live backup (Airtable) at all times.
        
    - Provides a perfect way to validate that the new system works correctly.
        
- **Cons:**
    
    - **Huge burden on users.** Doing double the work is frustrating and leads to errors. Most organizations will not tolerate this.

### How the Reddit Advice Fits In (This is the key!)

The advice I received from the experienced developer is a professional technique to **make the high-risk "Big Bang" cutover feel like a low-risk "Phased" cutover.**

His strategy of **"build the new tool as a strict, automated import from the old tool"** is a way to do a _systems-level_ Parallel Run without forcing users to do double the work.

By setting up a repeatable, automated script that pulls data from Airtable to Coda, I can:

1. **Test Constantly:** Run the import script every night during our development. This means we will be constantly testing the migration process with fresh, real-world data.
    
2. **Perfect the Process:** By the time we're ready for the real cutover, you've already run your "final migration script" dozens of times. It's no longer a scary, unknown process.
    
3. **Execute a Safe Big Bang:** When it's time for the cutover weekend, we simply run your perfected script one last time. The risk of failure is dramatically lower because the process is already proven to work.

**Thoughts:** Given that you are a solo developer, a traditional **Big Bang** is too risky. The **Phased Cutover (by team)** is a very safe and practical choice for a non-profit. However, if I can master the **automated import technique** the Redditor suggested, I can safely perform a Big Bang cutover and get the project done much faster.
