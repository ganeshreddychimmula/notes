Obsidian employs a structured, yet flexible, folder system to organize your knowledge network. While the system utilizes six folders, only three are actively used daily for note-taking, with the others largely sitting in the background.

TAGS: [[Introduction to the Zettelkasten Method]] 

Here's what each folder can contain, with mentioned and similar examples:

- [[1 Rough Notes - Guide]]: This folder functions as a **temporary notepad** where you can jot down anything temporary, such as ideas, reminders, or other rough notes. It's akin to a scratchpad for things you don't want to forget, and its use is entirely **optional** based on your personal preference. For instance, you might keep a list of ideas for future research or track your daily word count for a writing habit here.
    
- [[1 Source Material - Guide]]: This folder is dedicated to storing insights gleaned from **all forms of consumed content**. This includes, but is not limited to, books, videos, articles, podcasts, and even Twitter threads.
    - **Creation of Source Material Notes**:
        - When you encounter something you want to note, you **create a new note in the "Source Material" folder** and title it with the name of the source (e.g., "Confessions of a Cartel Hitman" for a book). If it's an online source, you would include the link.
        - As you review the source, you should **write down page numbers** (if applicable) and **relevant quotes**.
        - **Crucially, you must then expand on these ideas in your own words**. This involves discussing your thoughts, what the idea reminded you of, or explaining it to yourself in a way you truly understand. This active process of rephrasing and reflecting is essential to avoid passive learning and to ensure deeper understanding and retention. Anna Howard notes that these source material notes are primarily for your "own understanding of the source".
        - For example, you might read a book and take a note on a character's loyalty, including the page number, a direct quote, and then your own elaboration on why loyalty is central to gang life or what it means to you. This process is repeated for each interesting idea you encounter in the source.
    - You can create optional subfolders within "Source Material" to categorize different types of content (e.g., "Books," "Videos"), but this is not mandatory. Notes that are actively being worked on can remain unsorted until they are finished.
- [[1 Tags - Guide]]: This folder is crucial for **navigating your knowledge network**, especially as it grows in size, helping to prevent clutter.
    - **Creation of Tags**:
        - Rather than using traditional hashtags directly within notes, the preferred method is to store **each tag as an empty note** within this "Tags" folder.
        - To apply a tag to a note, you **create a link to this empty tag note** using double square brackets (e.g., `[[humility]]`).
        - When you first create such a link, it will appear grayed out if the tag note doesn't exist. Clicking on this grayed-out link automatically **creates the tag note**. You then **move this newly created tag note into your "Tags" folder**. Once created and moved, this tag note can be **infinitely reused** across many other notes.
    - **Pointers for Effective Tagging**:
        - **Avoid vague tags**: Tags like "self-improvement" are too broad and unhelpful, as they could encompass many disparate topics.
        - **Avoid overly precise tags**: Strive for a middle ground where tags are general enough to be reusable but specific enough to be meaningful. Ask yourself if you will likely use the tag again for future content.
        - **Align tags with your personal interests**: Your tags should reflect what _you_ are interested in, not necessarily common or general categories. For instance, a tag like "dangers to male-female relationships" might be niche but useful if it aligns with your specific interests, as it will reveal your thought patterns.
        - **Limit the number of tags**: Aim to keep the number of tags per note low, ideally **below four or five**. Too many tags (e.g., six, seven, or eight) can make the system confusing and messy.
        - **Finding forgotten tags**: If you forget an existing tag, you can search for similar notes using the hyperlink function and then check the tags used in those notes, which might remind you of the tag you're looking for.
- [[1 Indexes - Guide]]: As your knowledge network expands and tags accumulate a significant number of linked notes, they can be transformed into indexes. Since tags are already notes themselves, an index serves as a **table of contents** for notes related to a particular tag. It provides a logical structure and an entry point for exploring the notes within that tag. For example, a "learning" tag with 51 linked notes could be turned into an index with subheadings to organize those notes. This folder is for later use as your system grows.
    
- [[1 Template - Guide]]: This folder has a single, straightforward purpose: to **store the template for your main notes**. Once set up, you generally won't need to interact with this folder directly. The template provides a basic structure that can be automatically pasted into new notes using a hotkey.
    
- **Main Notes (Workhorse)**: This is the **core of your system**, where every primary or "atomic" note resides. Unlike traditional systems that use numerous sub-folders, keeping all main notes in one folder maintains **flexibility and openness to connections** between ideas. This setup encourages "chaos to slowly turn into order" as natural clusters and patterns of interest emerge from the interconnectedness of your notes. These notes are intended to be independent and self-explanatory, allowing them to connect freely with other ideas and encouraging a focus on the "bigger picture". Anna Howard refers to these as "your thoughts" about the world, which may reference source material but are primarily your own reflections.


## Building your second brain
Obsidian is described as "the King of Learning Tools" and a powerful application for building a **personal network of knowledge**, often referred to as a **Zettelkasten** or a **second brain**. The creator of the video, Odysseas, views this system as his most valuable asset for reading, writing, and thinking. Anna Howard further elaborates on this, likening it to a **digital garden** and "your own personal Wikipedia," where ideas are interconnected through contextual relationships and associative links rather than chronological timelines.

### The Problem

The initial attempt to set up a Zettelkasten in Obsidian presented significant challenges for the creator, describing it as "a pain in the ass to get started". The core issues were:

- **Information Overload and "Toxic Perfectionism"**: Searching for setup guides online yields hundreds of videos, each proposing a slightly different method. This abundance led to a "toxic sense of perfectionism," causing the creator to cherry-pick "nice features" or "shiny gems" from various sources. This resulted in a "Frankenstein's monster of a setup that tries to be everything but fails".
- **Distraction from "True Work"**: The obsession with achieving a non-existent "perfect setup" consumed months, preventing actual writing. Any added features often became "pointless gimmicks" and distractions.
- **Shallow Consumption and Poor Retention**: Before this system, the creator felt exhausted by learning efforts that "Vanished Into Thin Air," forgetting important things from books and failing to reflect on their content. This aligns with Anna Howard's observation that modern over-consumption often leads to being "in a daze," where information goes "in one ear and out the other," and an inability to remember details like names of shows or books, or to deeply process why one agrees or disagrees with something.

### How it Solves These Problems

The solution presented is a **simple, minimalistic, and "bullshit-free" setup** that focuses only on essential features. This simplicity allowed the creator to focus on writing and has proven effective over nine months with hundreds of notes.

The system addresses the problems through several key benefits:

- **Forces You to Slow Down and Deepen Understanding**:
    - It emphasizes **thorough note-taking** over speed reading, which compels you to "dwell on the author's ideas".
    - This deliberate slowness leads to **better retention** and a **deeper understanding** of concepts. Anna Howard reinforces this, stating that going "too fast" leads to not remembering names or what books are about.
- **Gives Instant Feedback on Your Learning**:
    - The act of writing notes provides an **immediate reflection of your own understanding**.
    - Struggling to articulate a concept signals a lack of full comprehension, prompting you to **revisit the source material** for clarity. This is an application of the Feynman technique.
- **Allows Your Notes to Form Connections (Digital Garden/Personal Wikipedia)**:
    - Unlike traditional subject-based folders that isolate ideas, this system frees notes to **interlink and mingle**, forming new insights from diverse sources.
    - This creates a "network" or "web" of ideas, a "digital garden" organized by "contextual relationships and associ links" rather than chronological order.
    - The more notes you add, the stronger your network becomes. This also helps you **rediscover forgotten notes by accident** through these links.
    - It functions as a "personal Wikipedia," where concepts are linked, allowing you to click on a term and explore all your related thoughts on that theme.
    - Anna Howard notes that this visualization of interconnected interests helps you identify patterns in your thinking and sparks new creative endeavors.
- **Helps Store and Mix Ideas (Centralized Digital Vault)**:
    - All notes are kept in **one digital location** (your "vault"), overcoming the limitations of multiple physical notebooks.
    - Storing your vault on a **cloud service** (e.g., Google Drive) ensures notes are backed up and **accessible from any device, anywhere**.
- **Enables Easier and Faster Writing**:
    - Instead of starting a writing project from scratch, you **collect ideas while reading about your interests**. As you take notes, **clusters of ideas naturally form** around topics.
    - Most of the writing occurs during the note-taking phase, making the final structuring and editing process much quicker.
    - Notes are **reusable across multiple projects**, preventing the need to re-research the same information. This system acts as a "personal writing assistant" that grows stronger over time.
    - A digital garden is never truly "finished" and provides a foundation for more formalized writing like articles or essays.

### The Process Explained in the Video (Detailed Setup Steps)

The video outlines a step-by-step process for setting up Obsidian and a note-taking workflow:

1. **Installation and Vault Creation**:
    
    - **Install Obsidian** from its website; it is free.
    - **Create a "Vault"**: This is the highest level of organization, essentially a folder on your computer where all notes are stored as files.
    - **Name your vault** and **choose its location**. It is highly recommended to store it on a **cloud service** (e.g., Google Drive, OneDrive) for backup and multi-device access.
2. **Folder Structure**: The system uses six folders, though only three are actively used daily for note-taking:
    
    - **Rough Notes**: A temporary notepad for ideas, reminders, or anything you don't want to forget. Its use is optional.
    - **Source Material**: Stores insights from all consumed content (books, videos, articles, podcasts, Twitter threads). You can create optional subfolders for different types. Notes actively being worked on can remain unsorted until finished.
    - **Tags**: Stores tags as empty notes, which is the preferred method over traditional hashtags. To apply a tag, you create a link to its note (e.g., `[[humility]]`). Clicking the grayed-out link creates the note, which is then moved to this "Tags" folder, allowing infinite reuse. Tags should be neither too vague nor too precise, and ideally relate to your personal interests, not common categories. Keep the number of tags per note low, ideally below four or five.
    - **Indexes**: Used for navigation as your knowledge network grows. When a tag accumulates enough linked notes, it can be turned into an index (since tags are notes themselves). An index acts like a table of contents, providing a logical structure to notes within that tag. This is for later use as the system grows.
    - **Template Folder**: Stores the template for your main notes.
    - **Main Notes (Workhorse)**: This is where every primary note goes. The lack of sub-folders for notes keeps the system flexible and open to connections, allowing "chaos to slowly turn into order" as patterns emerge from links. This is where the core "Zettelkasten" or "Atomic notes" reside.
3. **Important Settings Setup**:
    
    - Go to **"Files and Links"** in settings: Set the **default location for new notes** to your "Main Notes" folder.
    - Go to **"Hotkeys"** in settings: Search for "template" and **assign a hotkey** (e.g., Ctrl+T or Cmd+T) to "insert template" for rapid note creation.
    - Go to **"Core Plugins"** in settings: **Turn on "Templates"**. The creator advises against over-complicating with too many community plugins, emphasizing the power of simplicity.
    - Go to the **"Template"** section in settings: Select the folder you created for your templates.
4. **Template Creation**:
    - Create a new note in your 
    - "Template Folder." This template will provide a basic structure for every new main note.
    - The template includes:
        - `{{date}}` and `{{time}}` to automatically insert the date and time.
        - A **"Status"** section for categorizing note development (e.g., `#bab` for new/undeveloped, `#child` for evolving, `#adult` for developed) and to mark notes with quotes (`#quote`).
        - A **"Tag"** section.
        - A **"Title"** section using hashtags for formatting (e.g., `# Title` for a large, bold title, `## Subheading` for smaller headings).
        - Blank space for the main content of the note.
        - A **"Reference"** heading at the bottom to link to source material and similar notes.
5. **Writing Notes Workflow**: The process involves two main types of notes:
    
    - **Source Material Notes**:
        
        - Create a new note in the "Source Material" folder with the **title of the source** (book, video, article, etc.).
        - As you review the source, write down page numbers (if applicable) and relevant quotes.
        - **Crucially, expand on these ideas in your own words**. Discuss your thoughts, what it reminded you of, or explain it to yourself in a way you understand. This active process forces reflection and deep internalization, preventing passive learning. Anna Howard differentiates these as notes for your "own understanding of the source".
    - **Main Notes (Decontextualized Notes)**:
        
        - These notes are **independent and self-explanatory**, meaning they can stand alone without needing the original source context. This standardization allows them to connect freely with other ideas and encourages thinking about the "bigger picture". Anna Howard describes these as "your thoughts" about the world, potentially referencing source material but primarily focused on your own reflections.
        - To create a new main note, press **`Ctrl+O`** (or `Cmd+O`), type the title, and press **`Shift+Enter`**. This also acts as a search to avoid duplicates.
        - Apply your template by pressing **`Ctrl+T`** (or `Cmd+T`).
        - **Status Tags (Optional)**: Use `#bab`, `#child`, or `#adult` to track the note's development, and `#quote` if it contains a quote.
        - **Tagging**:
            - Choose tags that are **neither too vague nor too precise**; they should be general enough to be reusable but specific enough to be useful.
            - **Tags should relate to your personal interests**, not just common categories (e.g., "dangers to male-female relationships" if it's a personal interest). Anna Howard also notes that tags act as "themes" that reveal "your patterns in what you are interested in".
            - Aim to keep the number of tags per note low, ideally **below four or five**.
            - If you forget existing tags, search for similar notes or check the linked notes at the bottom of relevant tags to find connections.
        - **Note Content**:
            - This is the bulk of the note where you discuss the idea to understand it better. You can copy-paste from source notes and then expand/edit, or use source notes as inspiration to write from scratch.
            - **Keep notes short, ideally under 500 words**, and concise enough to fit on one page without scrolling. This ensures versatility.
            - **Focus each note on a single idea** to maintain clarity and flexibility. If you want to expand on a concept, create a new note and link it back, rather than creating a complicated, jumbled note.
            - **Format notes for readability** by including spaces between lines at natural break points.
        - **Referencing**:
            - At the bottom, in the "Reference" section, **create hyperlinks to any similar notes** you've written.
            - Also, **link to the original source material note**. This makes it easy to trace ideas back to their origin and revisit sources if needed. The linking process is similar to tagging (double square brackets, then search).

### Questions

When you are learning React from React documentation, here's how you would use the "Source Material" and "Main Notes" folders:

1. **Source Material Folder:**
    
    - You would **create a new note in the "Source Material" folder** and title it with the name of the documentation (e.g., "React Documentation"). Since it's an online source, you would also **include the link to the documentation** in this note.
    - As you review the documentation, you should **write down relevant quotes** or specific code examples you want to remember.
    - **Crucially, you must then expand on these ideas in your own words**. This means discussing your thoughts on the concept, what it reminded you of, or explaining it to yourself in a way you truly understand. This active process of rephrasing and reflecting is essential to avoid passive learning and to ensure deeper understanding and retention. Anna Howard emphasizes that these source material notes are primarily for your "own understanding of the source material".
2. **Main Notes (Workhorse) Folder:**
    
    - This is the **core of your system** where your primary, "atomic" notes reside. These notes are meant to be **independent and self-explanatory**, decontextualized from the specific source material. They are your "thoughts" about the world, which may reference source material but are primarily your own reflections and interpretations.
    - You would create new notes in this folder that represent **key ideas or takeaways** gleaned from the React documentation. For instance, if you encounter a fundamental React concept like "component lifecycle" multiple times in the documentation, you would create a main note on "Component Lifecycle".
    - In these main notes, you would ask "so what? why does this matter? what does this mean?" regarding the information from the source material. This allows you to **talk about the bigger picture** and standardize your understanding, allowing these ideas to connect freely with other concepts across your knowledge network.
    - The goal is to capture your interpretation and understanding, not just a summary of the source.

**Why this Two-Step Process is Effective:**

- **Deeper Understanding:** The act of processing source material and then articulating your own thoughts in separate notes forces you to **slow down** and genuinely understand the concepts, rather than just passively consuming information. If you struggle to put a concept into your own words, it's a clear sign you need to revisit the documentation and deepen your grasp on it.
- **Connection and Insight:** By separating your original thoughts from the source material, your "Main Notes" become **flexible and open to connections**. This allows your ideas to "mingle" and connect with insights from other sources, fostering novel understandings and making it easier to build new articles, speeches, or projects, as much of the "writing" is already done in the form of these interconnected notes. This helps you see how your interests are interconnected, like roots of trees underground.
- **Reusability and Future-Proofing:** Notes in Obsidian are stored as plain text files, meaning they are accessible and reusable across different applications and will remain readable as long as computers exist. This prevents your research and ideas from being "stuck" within a specific project or application.
- **Emergence of Patterns:** As you add more notes to your "Main Notes" folder, **natural clusters and patterns of interest will begin to form** due to the links you create. This allows you to visually see your learning journey and identify areas where you might want to delve deeper.
- **Focus on Thinking and Writing:** Obsidian's design, which places formatting and complex folder structures in the background, encourages you to focus on the "most important value creating activity: which is actually **thinking, writing out those ideas and expanding those thoughts**".
