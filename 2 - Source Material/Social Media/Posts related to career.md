- Job opportunities in Front End seem to be diminishing. 
-  _High demand for senior devs, but difficulty for juniors to get hired._
- _Companies hesitate to hire juniors due to high supply and potential AI impact._
- _Paradox: Must hire juniors to develop future mid/senior talent._
- Suggests companies are missing out by not investing in junior mentorship._
- Does just improving skills to match the senior dev solve the problem?
- Would that role be eventually phased out and integrated into more broad roles?
- How real is this Issue or Is this just scare tactic?
