# How to work out what your users really need
https://posthog.com/blog/how-to-work-out-what-users-need?utm_source=neilkakkar

When building a product, your users don’t always know what they need; and when they do, they might not be able to express it clearly. The role of a Product Manager is to piece together multiple pieces of information to identify actual user needs and empower a team to solve them. Below are a few ways you can gather this information. 

## Interviews

Speaking 1:1 with customers is a great way to immerse yourself in their experience and the daily problems they encounter.  It’s key when interviewing customers that you avoid biased or leading questions. To get unfiltered answers, ask open questions such as “Can you talk me through how you would travel home from an airport?” rather than “Can you tell me about the last time you took a taxi?” or “Did you take a taxi in the last 7 days?”.

## Surveys

Asking people what their needs are at scale is a great way to validate the need for your product and get a sense of which problems to prioritize. When surveying people, ask the right mix of open and closed questions to increase response rates and allow for more creative answers.

Keep your surveys short so that people can complete them quickly and easily. You may need to incentivize people to respond - but be aware that heavy incentives may provide biased answers. Additionally, look to reduce bias by randomly sampling your user base.
