# A Framework for First Principles Thinking
https://neilkakkar.com/A-framework-for-First-Principles-Thinking.html

> A first principle is a foundational statement assumed to be true, that can’t be deduced from any other within that system.

The framework for First Principles Thinking depends on systems and the first principles for a system.

## The System

One heuristic I use to define systems is — resolution or the scope of the problem. How deep do you want to look, what all components does the question you’re trying to answer need.


## The First Principles

As we saw already, these are absolute truths for a system — principles that can’t be derived from any other principle **within the system.**

The “_within the system_” is key.

This takes tremendous mental effort. It might seem trivial regarding the flat earth theory, but think of this happening to your most dearly held beliefs. Like, How do I know God exists? How do I know the GOP is doing anything for the people? How do I know I’m doing the right thing? How do I know nobody cares? How do I know I’m lucky? How do I know I’m unlucky?

> To disintegrate something you’ve believed to be true takes courage.

Identifying all your conclusions that were based on the assumption that the earth is flat.

This can take years to work through, depending on the subtlety of the principle. Depending on how conscious you were of the first principle when reaching a conclusion.

> _Think for yourself to decide 1) what you want, 2) what is true, and 3) what you should do to achieve #1 in light of #2, and do that with humility and open-mindedness so that you consider the best thinking available to you. — Ray Dalio, Principles_

The brain wants to minimise its energy expenditure. After all, it already takes up [15% of the energy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3516137) used by the entire body. This means, it doesn’t want to think through everything over and over again.

So, the brain creates shortcuts. The first time you have a question, you turn to culture or you use first principles to reach a conclusion. Either way, the brain remembers the conclusion so you don’t have to think through it again. The next time, you begin at the conclusion.

> Once you’ve thought through a problem, you begin thinking from the conclusion every time afterwards
