# AHA Programming
https://kentcdodds.com/blog/aha-programming

[DRY (an acronym for "Don't Repeat Yourself")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)

> Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system

- The problem with multiple instances of same code is, if you find a bug, add info, or generally better way of doing it, you need to change the code everywhere.

## [WET](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/aha-programming#wet)
"Write Everything Twice."
> You can ask yourself "Haven't I written this before?" two times, but never three.

## [AHA ðŸ’¡](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/aha-programming#aha-) 
>  Avoid Hasty Abstractions

> Prefer duplication over the wrong abstraction


> Optimize for change first

The rationale behind "Optimize for change first" is that the future of code is uncertain; time spent optimizing for performance or creating the "best API" for an abstraction might be wasted if assumptions prove incorrect or features are no longer needed. ==The only certainty is that things will likely change, and if they don't, the code won't be touched anyway.==

Code duplication is fine if you know the use-cases for the duplicate code. Once commonalities in several instances of duplicated code "scream" for abstraction, one will be in the right mindset to create it.

Â The main message of "AHA Programming" is **not to be dogmatic about when to start writing abstractions**. Instead, **write the abstraction when it** **feels** **right, and do not be afraid to duplicate code until that point**
Â - Don't start with abstraction, but abstract when it feels right to abstract, you reach a point where you realize you are just repeating the code for same use case.
