# How to Make Things Happen
https://scottberkun.com/2012/how-to-make-things-happen/

The ability to make things happen is a combination of knowing how to be a catalyst in different situations, and having the courage to do so.

The belief is that if he isn’t agile or flexible enough to adapt his skills and knowledge to the situations at hand, and find ways to drive things forward, then he won’t survive, much less thrive, on a typical project.

### Priorities Make Things Happen

An ordered list is just a column of things, put in order of importance. I’m convinced that despite all of the knowledge and skills I was expected to have and use, in total, all I really did was make ordered lists.
I collected things that had to be done—requirements, features, bugs, whatever—and put them in an order of importance to the project. I spent hours and days refining and revising these lists, integrating new ideas and information, debating and discussing them with others, always making sure they were rock solid.
Sometimes, these lists involved how my own time should be spent on a given day; other times, the lists involved what entire teams of people would do over weeks or months. But the process and the effect were the same.

I invested so much time in these lists because I knew that having clear priorities was the backbone of progress. `"Making things happen is dependent on having a clear sense of which things are more important than others and applying that sense to every single interaction that takes place on the team".`  

These priorities have to be reflected in every email you send, question you ask, and meeting you hold.

What slows progress and wastes the most time on projects is confusion about what the goals are or which things should come before which other things.

This isn’t to say those debates about priorities shouldn’t happen—they should. But they should happen early as part of whatever planning process you’re using. If the same arguments keep resurfacing during development, it means people were not effectively convinced of the decision, or they have forgotten the logic and need to be reminded of why those decisions were made0

Ordered lists provide everyone with a shared framework of logic to inherit their decisions from. If the goals are clear and understood, there is less need for interpretation and fewer chances for wasted effort.

### Common ordered lists

For most projects, the three most important and most formal ordered lists are used to prioritize project goals, features, and work items

The project goals are typically part of the vision document or are derived from it. The lists of features and work items are the output of the design process.Because each of these lists inherits priorities from the preceding list, by stepping up a level to reach a point of clarity and then reapplying those priorities back down to the level in question, any disputes can begin to be resolved. Although this may not always resolve debates, it will make sure that every decision was made in the context of what’s truly important.

Other important things that might need ordered lists include bugs, customer suggestions, employee bonuses, and team budgets.

If you do use the three most common ordered lists, make sure that they always map to each other. Every engineering work item should map to a feature, and every feature should map to a goal.

If a VP or programmer wants to slip something extra in, she should be forced to justify it against what the project is trying to achieve: “That’s a great feature, boss, but which goal will it help us satisfy? Either we should adjust the goals and deal with the consequences, or we shouldn’t be investing energy here".

### Priority 1 versus everything else

Typically, these ordered lists have one important line dividing them into two pieces. The top part is priority 1: things we must do and cannot possibly succeed without. The second part is everything else. Priorities 2 and 3 exist but are understood to be entirely different kinds of things from priority 1. It is very difficult to promote priority 2 items into priority 1.

This priority 1 line must be taken very seriously. You should fight hard to make that list as small and tight as possible (this applies to any goal lists in the vision document as well)

An item in the priority 1 list means “We will die without this.” It does not mean things that are nice to have or that we really want to have: it gives the tightest, leanest way to meet the project goals.

For example, if we were building an automobile, the only priority 1 things would be the engine, tires, transmission, brakes, steering wheel, and pedals. Priority 2 items would be the doors, windshield, air conditioning, and radio because you can get around without those things. The core functionality of the automobile exists without them; you could ship it and still call it a car.

Having sharpened it through debate and argument, we were ready for 90% of the common questions or challenges people might have later on (i.e., why we were building brakes but not air conditioning) and could quickly dispatch them: we’d heard the arguments before, and we knew why they didn’t hold up.

The challenge of prioritization is always more emotional/psychological than intellectual, despite what people say. Just like dieting to lose weight or budgeting to save money, eliminating things you want (but don’t need) requires being disciplined, committed, and focused on the important goals. Saying “stability is important” is one thing, but stack ranking it against other important things is entirely different.

They hedge, delay, and deny the tough choices, and the result is that they set their projects up to fail. ==No tough choices means no progress.==




### Priorities are power

They had an ordered list in their heads and were able to get other people to frame the discussion around it. Good priorities are power. They eliminate secondary variables from the discussion, making it possible to focus and resolve issues.

This refreshes everyone’s sense of what success is, visibly dividing the universe into two piles: things that are important and things that are nice, but not important

Here are some sample questions:

- What problem are we trying to solve?
- If there are multiple problems, which one is most important?
- How does this problem relate to or impact our goals?
- What is the simplest way to fix this that will allow us to meet our goals?
### Be a prioritization machine

Whenever I talked with programmers or testers and heard about their issues or challenges, I realized that my primary value was in helping them focus. My aim was to eliminate secondary or tertiary things from their plates and to help them see a clear order of work. There are 1,000 ways to implement a particular web page design or database system to spec, but only a handful of them will really nail the objectives.

## Things Happen When You Say No

One side effect of having priorities is how often you have to say no. It’s one of the smallest words in the English language, yet many people have trouble saying it. The problem is that if you can’t say no, you can’t have priorities. The universe is a large place, but your priority 1 list should be very small. Therefore, most of what people in the world (or on your team) might think are great ideas will end up not matching the goals of the project. It doesn’t mean their ideas are bad; it just means their ideas won’t contribute to this particular project. So, a fundamental law of the PM universe is this: if you can’t say no, you can’t manage a project.

When you do say no, and make it stick, the project gains momentum. Eliminating tasks from people’s plates gives them more energy and motivation to focus and work hard on what they need to do.

### Master the many ways to say no

Sometimes, you will need to say no in direct response to a feature request. Other times, you’ll need to interject yourself into a conversation or meeting, identify the conflict with priorities you’ve overheard, and effectively say no to whatever was being discussed. To prepare yourself for this, you need to know all of the different flavors that the word _no_ comes in:

- **No, this doesn’t fit our priorities**
- **No, only if we have time**.
- **No, only if you make `insert impossible thing here` happen**.
- **No. Next release**.
- **No. Never. Ever. Really**

## Keeping It Real

Some teams have a better sense of reality than others.  As a rule, the further a team gets from reality, the harder it is to make good things happen. Team leaders must play the role of keeping their team honest (in the sense that the team can lose touch with reality, not that they deliberately lie),

Calling bull* makes things happen. If people expect you will ask them tough questions, and not hesitate to push them hard until you get answers, they will prepare for them before they meet with you.

They will not waste your or your team’s time. Remember that all kinds of deception, including self-deception, work against projects. The sooner the truth comes to light, the sooner you can do something about it. Because most people avoid conflict and prefer to pretend things are OK (even when there is evidence they are not), someone has to push to get the truth out. The more you can keep the truth out in the open, the more your team can stay low to the ground, moving at high speed.

## Know the Critical Path

In project management terminology, the critical path is the shortest sequence of work that can complete the project. In critical path analysis, a diagram or flowchart is made of all work items, showing which items are dependent on which others. If done properly, this diagram shows where the bottlenecks will be. For example, if features A, B, and C can’t be completed until D is done, then D is on the critical path for that part of the project. This is important because if D is delayed or done poorly, it will seriously impact the completion of work items A, B, and C. It’s important then for a project manager to be able to plan and prioritize the critical path.

From a higher-level perspective, there is a critical path to all situations. They don’t need to be diagrammed or measured to the same level of detail, but the thought processes in assessing many PM situations are similar: look at the problem as a series of links, and see where the bottlenecks or critical points are.

Always have a sense for the critical path of:

- The project’s engineering work (as described briefly earlier)
- The project’s high-level decision-making process (who is slowing the team down?)
- The team’s processes for building code or triaging bugs (are there needless forms, meetings, or approvals?)
- The production process of propping content to the Web or intranet
- Any meeting, situation, or process that impacts project goals

Making things happen effectively requires a strong sense of critical paths.

For some organizations, the fastest way to improve the (non-engineering) critical path is to distribute authority across the team. Instead of requiring consensus, let individuals make decisions and use their own judgment as to when consensus is needed.

 Often the best way of improving critical paths in organizations is to remove processes and shift authority down and across a team, instead of creating new processes or hierarchies.
## Be Relentless

Many smart people can recognize when there is a problem, but few are willing to expend the energy necessary to find a solution, and then summon the courage to do it. There are always easier ways: give up, accept a partial solution, procrastinate until it goes away (fingers crossed), or blame others.

The harder way is to take the problem head-on and resist giving in to conclusions that don’t allow for satisfaction of the goals. Successful project managers simply do not give up easily. If something is important to the project, they will act aggressively—using any means necessary—to find an answer or solve the problem. This might mean reorganizing a dysfunctional team, getting a difficult room of people to agree on goals, finding answers to questions, or settling disagreements between people.

 It’s often the PM who has to question people, challenge assumptions, and seek the truth, regardless of how uncomfortable it might make others (although the goal is to do this in a way that makes them as comfortable as possible).
The question “How do you know what you know?” is the simplest way to clarify what is assumed and what is real, yet many people are afraid, or forget, to ask it.

Being relentless means believing that 99% of the time there is a solution to the problem (including, in some cases, changing the definition of the problem), and that if it can’t be found with the information at hand, then deeper and more probing questions need to be asked, no matter who has to be challenged. The success of the project has to come first.

If you make it clear that you are dead serious and will fight to the end about a particular issue, you force more possibilities to arise

Being relentless is fundamental to making things happen. There are so many different ways for projects to slide into failure that unless there is at least one emotional force behind the project—pushing it forward, seeking out alternatives, believing there is always a way out of every problem and trap—the project is unlikely to succeed.

## Be Savvy

But being relentless doesn’t mean you have to knock on every door, chase people down the hallway, or stay at work until you pass out at your desk. Sheer quantity of effort can be noble and good, but always look for ways to work smart rather than just hard. Be relentless in spirit, but clever and savvy in action. Just because you refuse to give up doesn’t mean you have to suffer through mindless, stupid, or frustrating activities (although sometimes they’re unavoidable). Look for smart ways around a problem or faster ways to resolve them. Make effective use of the people around you instead of assuming you have to do everything yourself. But most importantly, be perceptive of what’s going on around you, with individuals and with teams.

Being savvy and environment-aware is most important in the following situations:

- Motivating and inspiring people
- Organizing teams and planning for action
- Settling arguments or breaking deadlocks
- Negotiating with other organizations or cultures
- Making arguments for resources
- Persuading anyone of anything
- Managing reports (personnel)

Here’s the savvy PM’s rough guide to evaluating an environment. These questions apply to an individual you might be working with or to the larger team or group:

- **What communication styles are being used?** Direct or indirect?
- **How broad or narrow is the group’s sense of humor?**
- **Are arguments won based on data?**
- **Who is effective at doing `<insert thing you are trying to do here>`, and what can I emulate or learn from them?**
- **In terms of actual behavior, what values are most important to this person or group?**
- **What is the organizational culture?**

### Guerilla tactics

Being savvy means you are looking for, and willing to take, the smarter route. The following list contains tactics that I’ve used successfully or have been successfully used on me

- **Go to the source**. - Don’t dillydally with people’s secondhand interpretations of what someone said, and don’t depend on written reports or emails for complex information. Find the actual person and talk to him directly.
- **Switch communication modes** - If communication isn’t working, switch the mode. Instead of email, call them on the phone. Instead of a phone call, drop by their office.
- **Get people alone**.
- **Hunt people down**.
- **Hide**
- **Get advice**
- **Call in favors, beg, and bribe**.
- **Play people off each other**
- **Buy people coffee and tasty things**

## Summary

- Everything can be represented in an ordered list. Most of the work of project management is correctly prioritizing things and leading the team in carrying them out.
- The three most basic ordered lists are: project goals (vision), list of features, and list of work items. They should always be in sync with each other. Each work item contributes to a feature, and each feature contributes to a goal.
- There is a bright yellow line between priority 1 work and everything else.
- Things happen when you say no. If you can’t say no, you effectively have no priorities.
- The PM has to keep the team honest and keep them close to reality.
- Knowing the critical path in engineering and team processes enables efficiency.
- You must be both relentless and savvy to make things happen.
