# From Feature Owner to Product Owner
https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/feature-owner-product-owner#:~:text=This%20transformation%20allows%20Product%20Owners%20to%20align,success%20in%20today's%20rapidly%20changing%20business%20environment.

In contrast, Agile product development focuses on the product itself. Prioritising the order in which items are delivered is the primary tool for delivering the most value early in the lifecycle. Gathering feedback from users, customers, and stakeholders frequently is also critical to affirm that the product being delivered is the right thing. Measuring value and checking Key Value Measures (KVM) is also essential to validate assumptions about what is valuable. Success is measured by the improvement of a KVM.

All products exist for a purpose, and there should be clear statements of what success looks like.

Focusing on delivering features is disempowering as it creates a “here’s a list of things someone else has decided upon. Now make it happen” attitude.

The best way of increasing the value your teams deliver is by not delivering items that have low value. By transforming feature owners into product owners, companies can improve the productivity of their organizations.

As a Product Owner, there are several ways you can increase your influence and take more ownership of your product. Here are five strategies to consider:

Build relationships with key stakeholders
Focus on user feedback
Be data-driven
Be proactive
Be a team player
