# Applying Extreme Ownership in Software Engineering
https://medium.com/@marijnscholtens/applying-extreme-ownership-in-software-engineering-1e1ca9235fa9

## Extreme Ownership: Taking Responsibility

Taking responsibility as a Software Engineer practically means this:

- You are responsible for all code that you write and test.
- You are responsible for all code that you review.
- You are responsible for the whole codebase that you are tasked to maintain.
- You are responsible for understanding the overall context of the project and where the part that you are working on fits in.
- You are responsible for making and maintaining contacts with anyone that is relevant for your project (bosses, IT support, stakeholders, clients, other teams, product owners, etc.)
- You are responsible for making sure that your code and everything around it (such as how you apply your agile methodology) is properly documented.
- You are responsible for making sure that you and your team can work properly in the right environment that contains everything you need, from good hardware to good chairs and having enough coffee.
- You are responsible for maintaining your knowledge and expanding it in this ever-evolving field, even if there is not much time.

It is your task to identify issues early on, document them, and present them to your manager, so that later on you cannot be held fully accountable for things that are not your fault. Or maybe you can ask for support, such as bringing in an additional competent teammate to help you, or ask for better equipment.

## Law One: Cover and Move

Cover and move, you can imagine one team to be a critical point handling things to cover other team to do critical things. In IT while you don't have life and death situations, everyone has different strengths and problems and must sometimes be able to cover for another.

- Identify the roles within the team, make sure you understand both your and other team members’ roles. Who is responsible for what part? Who does the backend, who does the frontend, who does the infrastructure, who is the leader etc.
- Closely related, identify the strengths within the team. Who has which competencies? What are everybody’s strong and weak points? Who could take over for whom?
- If your team is rigidly dividing the roles, such as some people doing only backend and some only frontend, make sure that there is a clear process in place for collaboration, implementation and testing of parts that require work at both the backend and frontend
- Develop both your strengths and weaknesses. It is fine to have weaknesses and you cannot be an expert anywhere but you should have at least basic knowledge of everything that is worked with in the project, even if you are not expected to work with it in your role.

## Law Two: Simple

_Simple_ is two-fold.
1. **Communication**
2. Simple and streamlined process

- Meetings become waste of time, if not organized efficiently
- Assignment and processing of any Tasks should be simple.
- Design your meetings efficiently. Reduce both the quantity and the length to the minimum and agree in advance what the purpose is of each meeting. What is the goal of the meeting? Do evaluate whether the meetings you do have been useful and productive.
- Each meeting should have an agenda. If you get invited to a meeting without an agenda, you shouldn’t go.
- Feel free to skip meetings if you don’t feel it is necessary, or ask a team mate that does attend to recap the key points to you afterwards.
- Have a template ready for writing user stories and tickets, and make clear who is available for questions if a task is not clear.
- Have a streamlined process in place for dealing with different branches, dealing with merge requests and reviews, and automated building of updates to your main branch.
- Define a “definition of done”, have a simple process in place to assess whether tasks are completed and verified.

When you are new to a project or a company, there are often already company-wide processes and procedures in place, and there is not much you can do to change them. Often, if you make suggestions to make changes, you will face resistance from both colleagues and the organization. <font color="red">Frequent statements you will meet are “that’s just how it works here” and “we have always done it this way” or “that’s how everybody else is doing it” or “that’s company policy”.</font>

<font color="yellow">Even when faced with resistance, its is your responsibility to explain that improvement could be made to organizational processes</font>. This will take time and should be done one at a time. As soon as you get settled in the project and have proven your worth, there is also a higher chance that you will be taken more serious.

Apart from the process having to be simple to understand, your team mates also need to understand why they are doing it this way or otherwise they might not follow the process. They have to _believe_ that the process makes sense. If they don’t follow the process, then either you need to explain the process better, or explain the _why_ better.

## Law Three: Prioritize and Execute

_Prioritize and Execute_ is also two-fold: Professional and private life

 The workload you face may highly differ depending on the project, company, and environment that you are working in.  Also not all tasks can be done at once, or ever be done at all. This is why priorities must be set and tasks need to be done in the order of importance.

- Have a proper understanding of the scope of your work that your team is tasked with, what the deliverables are, where to deliver them, whom to inform, and what the deadlines are.
- Have a process in place to collect and prioritize tasks, for example by using a Scrum process with a planning ritual to assign priorities to tasks, i.e. which to choose for the upcoming sprint and which to keep in the backlog.
- Be flexible enough to shift the priorities if an urgent issue comes up, such as critical bugs or security incidents.
- Sometimes investing time in automation beforehand can save a lot of time later when doing the actual work, rather than doing overhead work manually.
- <font color="yellow">“We will test and refactor it later” is one of the biggest lies in software engineering</font> . Yes, feature development will go faster if you forgo testing and refactoring, but the code quality may be very poor and the codebase can be unmaintainable over time.
- Evaluate whether your process is delivering satisfactory results, and whether priorities were properly set. Is the most important work finished consistently on time? If not, you may need to improve the process.

 <font color="yellow">If you don’t have your private life in order, you will experience difficulties to optimally perform in your team.</font>

## Law Four: Decentralized Command

_Decentralized Command_ is an essential concept when you organize a hierarchy.

Everybody owns a part of the code, typically what they are working on, and they should have some degree of autonomy to execute tasks and solve issues in their preferred way that they feel is best.

In a team there will typically be some coding standards and rules to adhere to, but often there is no one right way to solve a task and everybody might take a totally different approach that may be better or worse than what someone else might do. It is important to grant your team mates the authority to solve issues the way they want to.

<font color="yellow">As long as the task at hand is solved in a satisfactory manner, it does not matter whether they used a for or a while loop, whether the algorithm could be slightly more efficient, whether the naming is to your liking, and a number of other minutiae.</font>

- Although the team is responsible as a whole for the project, every team members should also own a piece of the project and be the first point of contact when it comes to their part.
- If you own a piece, you should not only do the tasks at hand, but also understand how it integrates with other pieces, and for example build documentation on your piece.
- Make sure that you also have some knowledge on the other pieces so you can step in and take over the responsibility if needed, for example in absence of the team member that normally is responsible for that piece.
- Sometimes pieces are explicitly assigned, sometimes they are not. If pieces are not explicitly assigned, you should feel free to ‘claim’ a piece of the project for yourself and take responsibility for it. Don’t wait for someone to assign it to you, but take it yourself. Should anyone complain, then take a humble stance and ask if they have a better idea. Often, you will get to retain your piece.
