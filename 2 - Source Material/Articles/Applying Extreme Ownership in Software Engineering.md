## Extreme Ownership: Taking Responsibility

Taking responsibility as a Software Engineer practically means this:

- You are responsible for all code that you write and test.
- You are responsible for all code that you review.
- You are responsible for the whole codebase that you are tasked to maintain.
- You are responsible for understanding the overall context of the project and where the part that you are working on fits in.
- You are responsible for making and maintaining contacts with anyone that is relevant for your project (bosses, IT support, stakeholders, clients, other teams, product owners, etc.)
- You are responsible for making sure that your code and everything around it (such as how you apply your agile methodology) is properly documented.
- You are responsible for making sure that you and your team can work properly in the right environment that contains everything you need, from good hardware to good chairs and having enough coffee.
- You are responsible for maintaining your knowledge and expanding it in this ever-evolving field, even if there is not much time.
