# Agile Product Ownership
https://re-magazine.ireb.org/articles/agile-product-ownership

Product owners are the champions of the product—and have ultimate accountability for the health and well being of that product.

They “own” the jointly derived product vision, must deeply and emphatically understand customer needs, keep a finger on the pulse of changing stakeholder values, and continuously make decisions on what to build (or not), and when. This is true whether the product is sold commercially or is used to operate the business.

Product owners—and the business analysts, requirements engineers, and testers who work with them—who handle the challenge successfully all seem to understand 9 essential practices, which are explained below.

### 1. Put the Ends before the Means.
Agile focuses on value, and delivering the highest value features as soon as possible. To do that effectively, all involved — from the c-suite to the delivery team — need to have their eyes fixed on value.

One of the many responsibilities of agile product ownership, and perhaps the most important, is to share, over and over, the vision, goals, and objectives for the product

### 2. Build Empathy for Your Customer.

### 3. Stand Up.

### 4. Cozy Up.

### 5. Fess Up.

### 6. Decide How to Decide.

### 7. Develop Telescoping Vision
Agile projects don’t attempt to understand or predict all product requirements up front. However, agile product owners still need to sketch out the long view of the product to establish a common focus and marshal organizational resources (people, money, space, governance). From that vantage point, product owners define what to build in each release, and then in each iteration. For large products, they collaborate and rely on product management to do this work.

### 8. Move in Measurable Inches.


### 9. Use Roadmaps as a Guide, but Don’t Pave Them.
