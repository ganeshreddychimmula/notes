# 80-20 principle
https://www.annakschaffner.com/post/80-20-principle-pareto-law-work-life-balance

It states that a surprisingly small proportion of efforts and inputs (20%) lead to 80% of our results.

By implication, the principle also suggests that the vast majority of our efforts, time, and resources is completely wasted. We tend naturally to assume that most of our efforts result in most of our outputs. But that belief is a fallacy.

Say defined the entrepreneur as somebody who “shifts economic resources out of an area of lower productivity into an area of higher productivity and yield.”

Our aim should not be blindly to optimize ourselves and to maximize our output and effectiveness at all costs, but, rather, <font color="red">to be discerning about what truly matters to us and to focus our energy on that</font> and to focus our energy on that. Even if we enhance our effectiveness, what really matters is still _how we put our effectiveness to use_.

Yet if we look beyond the input/output and optimization metaphors, we can see that what Koch is talking about is how to spend our time and energy more wisely. And Koch is truly radical when it comes to time. Most of us feel short of time, as though the day does not have enough hours. We feel that there is always too much on our to-do lists and simply not enough time in the day to get through them. <font color="orange">Koch argues the exact opposite: we are awash with time, and profligate in its abuse. We have more than enough time. Our true problem is simply that we do not use it well</font>.

We should, he suggests, radically eliminate all low-value activities. If we can identify the 20% of our activities that matter – in whatever sphere – we can focus on just that and let go of the 80% of unproductive activities. As a consequence, we will suddenly have much more leisure and thinking time available to us:<font color="red"> “If we double our time on our top 20 percent of activities, we can work a two-day week and achieve 60 percent more than now.”</font>

Most of us are _not_ completely autonomous masters of our time. We may have children, partners, and dependents, and mortgages we must pay; we may work for other people or institutions who dictate our to-do lists and _force_ us to spend our time in unproductive ways. We may also work in teams and be constantly dependent on other people’s input.

## 80/20 and the Stoic Circle of Control
So, a more realistic way of looking at the 80/20 principle would be to seek to apply it within our circle of control. That means being very discerning about what we can and what we cannot control, and then focusing our energy on the former. We can then apply the principle to the activities and freedoms that are clearly located within our circle of control.
