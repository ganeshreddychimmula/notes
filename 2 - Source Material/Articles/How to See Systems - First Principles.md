# How to See Systems - First Principles
https://neilkakkar.com/How-to-see-Systems-in-everyday-life.html

**Systems theory** is the [transdisciplinary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transdisciplinarity "Transdisciplinarity")[1](1)(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theory#cite_note-1) study of [systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System "System"), i.e. cohesive groups of interrelated, interdependent components that can be [natural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural "Natural") or [artificial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial "Artificial"). Every system has causal boundaries, is influenced by its context, defined by its structure, function and role, and expressed through its relations with other systems. A system is "more than the sum of its parts" when it expresses [synergy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy "Synergy") or [emergent behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergent_behavior "Emergent behavior").[2](2)(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theory#cite_note-2)

Since almost everything is a system, we can leverage concepts from System Theory to solve almost any problem.

e.g:
> Greater revenue can create a better product, as much as a better product can create greater revenue.

What if you could see the feedback loops and use them to solve problems? Welcome to the world of Systems Thinking.

> If A causes B, it becomes possible that B causes A too.

First off — the building blocks. There are only two. Together, they make up every system imaginable.
#### Balancing Feedback Loops

They attempt to bring a system to an equilibrium state. They provide negative feedback, and hence, also known as **negative feedback loops.**

This has nothing to do with the loops themselves being good or bad.
#### Reinforcing Feedback Loops

They attempt to exponentiate a system. They provide positive feedback, and hence, also known as **positive feedback loops.**

Every system which can multiply itself has potential for creating a reinforcing loop.Every system which can multiply itself has potential for creating a reinforcing loop.

The Winner take all effect is a reinforcing loop in the business world system.

e.g.
Consider Facebook. You have an algorithm which decides what shows up in the feed. If it’s something people love, people will stick to Facebook and tell their friends about how awesome Facebook is. A reinforcing loop. This leads to more time spent on Facebook, hence more revenue for Facebook. A better earnings quarter gives more confidence to shareholders, driving the stock price up — another reinforcing loop. With the stock market, there is a fear of crashing down — a balancing loop, moderating investment.

A better share price, higher revenue attracts more tech talent to Facebook. **And that results in … a better feed algorithm.** The ultimate reinforcing loop. Would be all rainbows and butterflies if the story ended here, right? The flip side, is that the loop works both ways — make a mistake with the algorithm, or sell data to a third party which the world finds out about, and people start distrusting Facebook, people start deleting Facebook, acquired start up founders start leaving Facebook, which drives down revenue, which drives down share price and drives down hiring. **And that results in … a worse feed.** Thus, the reinforcing loop continues.

> Systems with similar feedback structure produce similar dynamic behaviours

The determinant of a system’s behavior is its function or purpose. As Charlie Munger would put it 

> Show me the incentives, and I’ll show you the outcomes

**The competing loops**

In every case, we have two or more loops pulling our system in different directions, towards different goals.

Both balancing and reinforcing loops are goal-seeking. The difference is the type of goal. Both have goals in opposite directions, hence the competition.

At any point, the system is moving towards one goal, or is in equilibrium. The loop moving the entire system to its goal is the `"dominant loop"`.

Given enough time, the dominant loop keeps changing. This concept of changing loops is **`"shifting dominance"`.**

#### Shifting dominance

The loop that’s dominant now, might not be dominant always.

It leads to complexities, since now you’re trying to understand the trend of the system. In money markets, it’s all about the loop dominance — is the market going up or down? When will the dominance change? [When moon, when lambo?](https://cryptobriefing.com/crypto-slang-lambos-on-the-moon/)

#### Delays

Things don’t work in expected way in real life though. There’s a delay between when you order and when the cars come to you. Let’s say it takes a week for the cars to come to you. What happens then?

To end, here’s something to think about, linking feedback loops and the 80/20 principle, by [Richard Koch](https://amzn.to/2QyIS6I).

> **In the absence of feedback loops, the natural distribution of phenomena would be 50/50–inputs of a given frequency would lead to commensurate results. It is only because of positive and negative feedback loops that causes do not have equal results. Yet it also seems to be true that powerful positive feedback loops only affect a small minority of the inputs.**
