# A simplistic explanation to mental models

### The Map isn’t the territory

This _map_ that we’ve built to streamline the sea of information present in the territory is exactly what’s called a Mental Model.

Mental models are **explanations of someone's thought process about how something works in the real world**. They are representations of the surrounding world, including the relationships between its various parts, and a person's intuitive perception about their own actions and their consequences. Essentially, mental models help to **shape behavior and set an approach to solving problems and performing tasks**.

A fundamental concept for understanding mental models is encapsulated in the phrase, **"The Map isn't the Territory"**.

- The **"map"** represents a mental model – a representation or abstraction of reality. Examples include Google Maps, a world map, or even a company's financial statements, policy documents, or a parenting manual.
- The **"territory"** is the actual ground or the complex, ever-shifting reality of our life and experiences.

**Purpose and Utility of Mental Models:** Mental models serve to **simplify complexity** by filtering out unnecessary information for a specific purpose. For instance, Google Maps effectively guides travel by providing only essential road information, not the number of trees on a street. They are useful guides that are explanatory and predictive. The more mental models (or "tools") you possess and are proficient with, the more diverse problems you can tackle. Charlie Munger suggests that 80 or 90 important models can account for about 90% of becoming a "worldly wise person".

**Limitations and Dangers of Mental Models:** Crucially, **"All mental models are wrong, but some are useful"**. They are imperfect reductions of what they represent; a perfectly faithful map would be as complex as the territory itself and therefore not useful.

- **Mistaking the map for the territory** is dangerous. If we rely solely on these abstractions, we might miss critical details or risks present in reality. This can lead to bad decisions, static rules, ignoring feedback, and reduced adaptability to change.
- Mental models, like old tools, can become outdated. The brain naturally creates these shortcuts to minimize energy expenditure, often remembering conclusions rather than rethinking problems from scratch every time. However, this means that if the underlying "rules of the game" (first principles) change, our outdated conclusions and processes can become obsolete.

**Mental Models as Tools:** Mental models can be thought of as **tools to build up your thinking, understand the world, condense immense amounts of information, and teach you what cues to look for when dealing with specific problems**. Just as a person with only a hammer sees every problem as a nail, relying on a limited or inappropriate mental model can hinder effective problem-solving.

**Dynamic Nature and Updating:** The world is dynamic, and **maps (mental models) are not meant to live forever as static references**. As territories change, our mental models must be flexible and adapt. Newtonian physics, while useful for centuries, was eventually updated by Einstein's theory of relativity when a new, more accurate "map" was needed to explain the universe.

- **Reality is the ultimate update**: Good mental models are built through feedback loops from real-world experiences. We should constantly update our internal maps based on our experiences, remembering that a map captures a territory at a moment in time and may not reflect current or future reality.
- **Consider the cartographer**: Mental models are not purely objective; they reflect the values, standards, and limitations of their creators.
- **Maps can influence territories**: Sometimes, people try to force reality to fit their models, leading to negative consequences.

**Examples:**

- **Useful examples** include Google Maps for navigation or financial statements for business analysis. Newtonian physics is also a useful model within its defined limits. The "Map isn't the Territory" itself is a mental model.
- **Less useful or "bad" mental models** are things like "Being a nice guy should get me all the girls I want" or racist stereotypes like "Canadians are very kind". These are often oversimplifications or outdated beliefs that do not accurately reflect the complexity of reality.

In essence, mental models are the conceptual frameworks we use to navigate and make sense of the world. They are powerful but imperfect tools that require continuous evaluation and updating against the ultimate reality of our experiences.
