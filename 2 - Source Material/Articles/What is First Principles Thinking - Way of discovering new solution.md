# What is First Principles Thinking - Way of discovering new solution

https://fs.blog/first-principles/

First principles thinking is one of the best ways to discover new solutions.

Sometimes called “reasoning from first principles,” it’s a tool to help break down complicated problems by separating what we know is absolutely true from anything that is an assumption. If you know the first principles of something, you can build the rest of your knowledge around them to produce something new.

Everything that exists is effectively a set of Lego blocks, assembled in a certain way, that can be taken apart and reassembled


## The Basics

First principles thinking doesn’t have to be quite so grand. When we do it, we aren’t necessarily looking for absolute truths—millennia of epistemological inquiry have shown us that these are hard to come by, and the scientific method has demonstrated that `"knowledge can be built only when we are actively trying to falsify it."` Rather, first principles thinking identifies the elements that are, in the context of any given situation, irreducible.

First principles do not provide a checklist of things that will always be true; `"our understanding of first principles evolves as we gain more knowledge"`. They are the foundation on which we must build, and thus will be different in every situation—but the more we know, the more we can challenge.

>“To understand is to know what to do.”

— Wittgenstein

## Techniques for Establishing First Principles

`"Challenge assumptions, take things apart, reconstruct it, If you never challenge you end-up trapped in a way things were always done"`

Some of us are naturally skeptical of what we’re told: Maybe it doesn’t match up to our experiences. Maybe it’s something that used to be true but isn’t true anymore. Or maybe we just think differently about something. When it comes down to it, everything that is not a law of nature is just a shared belief. Money is a shared belief. So is a border. So is Bitcoin. So is love. The list goes on.

There are two techniques we can use to change the level where we are looking at a situation, identify the first principles, and cut through the dogma and shared belief: 
1. Socratic questioning
2. the Five Whys.

### Socratic Questioning

This a disciplined questioning process, used to establish truths, reveal underlying assumptions, and separate knowledge from ignorance.

Socratic questioning generally follows this process:

1. Clarifying your thinking and explaining the origins of your ideas (Why do I think this? What exactly do I think?)
2. Challenging assumptions (How do I know this is true? What if I thought the opposite?)
3. Looking for evidence (How can I back this up? What are the sources?)
4. Considering alternative perspectives (What might others think? How do I know I am correct?)
5. Examining consequences and implications (What if I am wrong? What are the consequences if I am?)
6. Questioning the original questions (Why did I think that? Was I correct? What conclusions can I draw from the reasoning process?)
This process stops you from relying on your gut and limits strong emotional responses. This process helps you build something that lasts.

### “Because I Said So” or “The Five Whys”
People hate the “because I said so” response for two reasons, both of which play out in the corporate world as well. The first reason we hate the game is that we feel like it slows us down. We know what we want to accomplish, and that response creates unnecessary drag. The second reason we hate this game is that after one or two questions, we are often lost. We actually don’t know why. Confronted with our own ignorance, we resort to self-defense.

>“Science is a way of thinking much more than it is a body of knowledge.”

— Carl Sagan
### Elon Musk and SpaceX

> I think people’s thinking process is too bound by convention or analogy to prior experiences. It’s rare that people try to think of something on a first principles basis. They’ll say, “We’ll do that because it’s always been done that way.” Or they’ll not do it because “Well, nobody’s ever done that, so it must not be good. But that’s just a ridiculous way to think. You have to build up the reasoning from the ground up—“from the first principles” is the phrase that’s used in physics. You look at the fundamentals and construct your reasoning from that, and then you see if you have a conclusion that works or doesn’t work, and it may or may not be different from what people have done in the past.

-- Elon Musk, quoted by Tim Urban in “The Cook and the Chef: Musk’s Secret Sauce,”

His approach to [understanding reality](https://fs.blog/alignment/) is to begin with what is true, rather than relying on his intuition. The problem is that we don’t know as much as we think we do, so our intuition isn’t very good. We trick ourselves into thinking we know what’s possible and what’s not.

Musk’s approach is quite different.
```
He starts out with something he wants to achieve, like building a rocket. Then he starts with the first principles of the problem. Running through how Musk would think, Larry Page said in an

interview, “What are the physics of it? How much time will it take? How much will it cost? How much cheaper can I make it? There’s this level of engineering and physics that you need to make judgments about what’s possible and interesting. Elon is unusual in that he knows that, and he also knows business and organization and leadership and governmental issues.”
```

> I think it’s important to reason from first principles rather than by analogy. So the normal way we conduct our lives is, we reason by analogy. We are doing this because it’s like something else that was done, or it is like what other people are doing… with slight iterations on a theme. And it’s … mentally easier to reason by analogy rather than from first principles. First principles is kind of a physics way of looking at the world, and what that really means is, you … boil things down to the most fundamental truths and say, “okay, what are we sure is true?” … and then reason up from there. That takes a lot more mental energy


> Somebody could say — and in fact people do — that battery packs are really expensive and that’s just the way they will always be because that’s the way they have been in the past. … Well, no, that’s pretty dumb… Because if you applied that reasoning to anything new, then you wouldn’t be able to ever get to that new thing…. you can’t say, … “oh, nobody wants a car because horses are great, and we’re used to them and they can eat grass and there’s lots of grass all over the place and … there’s no gasoline that people can buy….”

>… they would say, “historically, it costs $600 per kilowatt-hour. And so it’s not going to be much better than that in the future. … So the first principles would be, … what are the material constituents of the batteries? What is the spot market value of the material constituents? … It’s got cobalt, nickel, aluminum, carbon, and some polymers for separation, and a steel can. So break that down on a material basis; if we bought that on a London Metal Exchange, what would each of these things cost? Oh, jeez, it’s … $80 per kilowatt-hour. So, clearly, you just need to think of clever ways to take those materials and combine them into the shape of a battery cell, and you can have batteries that are much, much cheaper than anyone realizes.

-- Musk

## Employing First Principles in Your Daily Life

Most of us have no problem thinking about what we want to achieve in life, at least when we’re young. We’re full of big dreams, big ideas, and boundless energy. The problem is that we let others tell us what’s possible, not only when it comes to our dreams but also when it comes to how we go after them. And when we let other people tell us what’s possible or what the best way to do something is, we outsource our thinking to someone else.

`"The real power of first-principles thinking is moving away from incremental improvement and into possibility"`. Letting others think for us means that we’re using their analogies, their conventions, and their possibilities. It means we’ve inherited a world that conforms to what they think. This is incremental thinking.

`"When we take what already exists and improve on it, we are in the shadow of others."` It’s only when we step back, ask ourselves what’s possible, and cut through the flawed analogies that we see what is possible. ==Analogies are beneficial; they make complex problems easier to communicate and increase understanding. Using them, however, is not without a cost. They limit our beliefs about what’s possible and allow people to argue without ever exposing our (faulty) thinking==. Analogies move us to see the problem in the same way that someone else sees the problem.

The gulf between what people currently see because their thinking is framed by someone else and what is physically possible is filled by the people who use first principles to think through problems.

First-principles thinking clears the clutter of what we’ve told ourselves and allows us to rebuild from the ground up. Sure, it’s a lot of work, but that’s why so few people are willing to do it. It’s also why the rewards for filling the chasm(gulf/difference) between possible and incremental improvement tend to be non-linear.

### Few of the limiting beliefs
- **I don’t have a good memory.** - reframe the problem into finding the most optimal way to store information in our brains.
- **“There is too much information out there.”** 
- **“All the good ideas are taken.”**
- **“We need to move first.”** - There is a lot of evidence showing that first movers in business are more likely to fail than latecomers. Yet this myth about the need to move first continues to exist. You have to break each situation down into its component parts and see what’s possible. That is the work of first-principles thinking.
- **“I can’t do that; it’s never been done before.”**

> “As to methods, there may be a million and then some, but principles are few. The man who grasps principles can successfully select his own methods. The man who tries methods, ignoring principles, is sure to have trouble.”

## Key Takeaways

First principles thinking is the art of breaking down complex problems into their most fundamental truths.

By reasoning from first principles, `"we identify root causes, strip away layers of complexity, and focus on the most effective solutions."` It allows us to step outside the way things have always been done and, instead, see what is possible.

First principles thinking is not easy. It requires a willingness to challenge the status quo. ==That’s why it’s often the domain of rebels and misfits who believe there must be a better way==. It’s the mindset of those willing to start from scratch and build from the ground up.

In a world focused on incremental improvement, first-principles thinking offers a competitive advantage because it is not widely practiced.
