# The Map is Not the territory
https://fs.blog/map-and-territory/

In order to use a map or model as accurately as possible, we should take into account three important principles:

1. Reality is the ultimate update.
2. Consider the cartographer.
3. Maps can influence territories.

We can and should update our maps based on our own experiences in the territory. That’s how good maps are built: through feedback loops created by explorers.

Maps are not purely objective creations. They reflect the values, standards, and limitations of their creators. Models are most useful when we consider them in the context in which they were created. What was the cartographer trying to achieve? How does this influence what is depicted in the map?

Jacob’s book is, in part, a cautionary tale about what can happen when faith in the model influences the decisions we make in the ­ territory— when we try to fit complexity into the simplification.

## Conclusion

The map is not the territory reminds us that our mental models of the world are not the same as the world itself. It cautions against confusing our abstractions and representations with the complex, ever-­shifting reality they aim to describe.

It is dangerous to mistake the map for the territory. Consider the person with an outstanding résumé who checks all the boxes on paper but can’t do the job.

Updating our maps is a difficult process of reconciling what we want to be true with what is true.

In many areas of life, we are offered maps by other people. We are reliant on the maps provided by experts, pundits, and teachers. In these cases, the best we can do is to choose our mapmakers wisely and to seek out those who are rigorous, transparent, and open to revision.

Ultimately, the map/territory distinction invites us to engage with the world as it is, not just as we imagine it. And remember, when you don’t make the map, choose your cartographer wisely.
