# Introduction to the Zettelkasten Method

[Zettelkasten Method](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/)

> "**A Zettelkasten is a personal tool for thinking and writing. It has hypertextual features to make a web of thoughts possible. The difference to other systems is that you create a web of thoughts instead of notes of arbitrary size and form, and emphasize connection, not a collection.**"

> **"Luhmann’s Zettelkasten is a collection of notes on paper slips with a special twist: It is a _hypertext_ that he could navigate the drawer cabinet containing all the paper slips with a _reasonable_ amount of time and energy. “Reasonable” means that it was reasonable for Luhmann, who, obsessed with his theory of society, was a workaholic and an enthusiastic bureaucrat. A hypertext needs to be surfable. On Wikipedia, you just need to click a link to get to the next article within Wikipedia’s hypertext. It requires more effort to follow a link if the hypertext is paper-based. The other problem is that you need a starting point for your ride. So Luhmann created his Zettelkasten to make his note collection surfable. He needed entry points and a mechanism to surf from one note to another in a productive way."** 

-  Basically collection of notes which are written on paper slips. 
-  These notes are used to navigate to other notes which themselves are used to navigate to Other notes or resources.
- Imagine a giant box full of index cards, each with a single idea or piece of information written on it. That's essentially what **Luhmann's Zettelkasten** was, but with a clever system that made it incredibly powerful.

	Think of it like an **old-school Wikipedia on paper**. Instead of clicking links on a computer, Luhmann had a way to "surf" through his physical notes. He'd have one note that would point him to another, and that one would point to a third, and so on. This created a network of connected ideas, almost like a web.
	
	The "special twist" was that he could do this surfing in a **reasonable amount of time and effort**, even though it was all on paper. "Reasonable" for him meant he was willing to put in a lot of work, because he was super dedicated to his research.
	
	He needed:
	
	- **Entry points:** Ways to find the first note he wanted to start with.
	- **A way to move between notes:** A system to easily follow the connections from one idea to the next.
	
	So, in simple terms, Luhmann's Zettelkasten was a unique system of interconnected paper notes that allowed him to quickly and efficiently explore his ideas, much like we click through links on the internet today, but with a physical, analog method.

**"Hypertextual"**: Hypertextual nature refers to ==the way information is structured and accessed in a non-linear fashion, primarily through the use of hyperlinks==. It's characterized by its interconnectedness, allowing readers to navigate information in a way that differs from traditional linear text. This interconnectedness is achieved through links that allow users to jump between different pieces of information, creating a personalized reading experience

1. **We can improve the connectivity of our thoughts.** The hyper-textual nature of the Zettelkasten enables us to connect ideas. These connections make new insights possible. Insights don’t happen in a vacuum. ==They are the result of making new ([unexpected](https://plus.maths.org/content/information-surprise)) connections.==
2. **We stop wasting our efforts.** Even if you don’t use any of your notes for a project you’re working on at the moment, you prepare the knowledge for future projects. At the very least, you improve the depth of processing information from that topic.
3. **We can tackle more complex problems.** It is very difficult to keep all the balls in the air if you juggle complex problems. The Zettelkasten Method allows you to concentrate on a small part of the problem and after that take a step back and look at it with a panorama vision.
	- Explanation :
		**"It is very difficult to keep all the balls in the air if you juggle complex problems."**
		
		Imagine you're trying to solve a really complicated puzzle. It has a thousand pieces, and they all look similar. If you try to hold every single piece in your head at once, or connect them all at the same time, you'd get overwhelmed very quickly. That's what "keeping all the balls in the air" means – trying to manage too many interconnected details of a complex problem at once. Our brains just aren't designed to hold that much information in our "working memory."
		
		**"The Zettelkasten Method allows you to concentrate on a small part of the problem and after that take a step back and look at it with a panorama vision."**
		
		This is where the Zettelkasten shines. Instead of trying to juggle everything, you:
		
		1. **Break it down:** Each "ball" (or piece of the puzzle) becomes a small, individual note in your Zettelkasten. Each note focuses on just _one_ specific idea, fact, or insight related to the problem.
		2. **Focus on the small part:** When you're writing a note, you only need to think about that single idea. You don't have to worry about how it connects to everything else _at that moment_. This reduces the mental load and makes the task manageable.
		3. **Connect the dots later:** Because of the linking system in the Zettelkasten, these small, individual notes aren't isolated. You connect them to other related notes. Over time, these connections build up.
		4. **"Panorama vision":** Once you have many individual notes connected in a network, you can "step back" and see the bigger picture. The connections you've made between individual ideas reveal patterns, relationships, and even new insights that you wouldn't have noticed if you were trying to hold everything in your head. It's like putting together those thousand puzzle pieces one by one, and suddenly, you see the whole beautiful image emerge.
		
		In essence, the Zettelkasten acts as an "external brain" or a "second brain." It holds all the tiny pieces of complex information for you, and it helps you discover how they fit together, freeing up your actual brain to focus on deeper thinking, problem-solving, and generating new ideas.
4. **The Zettelkasten Method will make your writing easier, more coherent, smoother and more convincing.** One of the main problems in writing and thinking is our limited capacity to follow one line of thought for a long period of time. Just think of meditation. It is even difficult to focus on a simple thing like breathing for a couple of minutes. Imagine how difficult it is to think about one issue for weeks and months to write a thesis. The Zettelkasten will hold your thoughts alive and help you to hold onto them.

> **""What are we to do with what we have written down? Certainly, at first, we will produce mostly garbage. But we have been educated to expect something useful from our activities and soon lose confidence if nothing useful seems to result. We should, therefore, reflect on whether and how we arrange our notes so that they are available for later access.""**

Let us begin with the most important traits of a Zettelkasten:

1. It’s hyper-textual.
2. It adheres to the _Principle of Atomicity_.
3. It is personal.
> _A Zettelkasten makes connecting and not collecting a priority_

**Second,** a Zettelkasten needs to adhere to the [Principle of Atomicity](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/create-zettel-from-reading-notes/). That means that each Zettel only contains one unit of knowledge and one only. These units are the atoms to which the principle of atomicity refers. To figure out what the atoms are, it helps when we ask ourselves what we want the molecules that we create from our note atoms to look like

In contrast, referring to an atomic note is unambiguous: when you reference it, you will know what the ‘thought’ is. There should be no room for guesswork. That is what the rule of atomicity means: Make sure that the layer of content and the boundaries between notes match and are well defined. Then and only then can it be a reference to an address identical to referencing a thought.

1. **A unique identifier**. This gives your Zettel an unambiguous address.
    
2. **The body of the Zettel**. This is where you write down what you want to capture: The piece of knowledge.
    
3. **References**. At the bottom of each Zettel, you either reference the source of the knowledge you capture or leave it blank if you capture your own thoughts.

The body of the Zettel contains the piece of knowledge you want to capture. It could be an argument, a concept, or anything along those lines.

The most important aspect of the body of the Zettel is that you write it in your own words. There is nothing wrong with capturing a verbatim quote on top. But one of the core rules to make the Zettelkasten work for you is to use your own words, instead of just copying and pasting something you believe is useful or insightful. This forces you to at least create a different version of it, your own version. This is one of the steps that lead to increased understanding of the material, and [it improves recall of the information you process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levels_of_Processing_model). Your Zettelkasten will truly be your own if its content is yours and not just a bunch of thoughts of other people.

The length of a Zettel is directly tied to what kind of hypertext you want to create. Do you want to create a web of excerpts? Then a Zettel should contain precisely one excerpt. Do you want to make a web of thoughts? Then a Zettel should contain precisely one thought. A Zettel is the base entity that has its own address. Therefore the length of the Zettel, what you consider the atom you want to create molecules from, is determined by the objective you want to achieve. Your thinking operates in units of thought. A Zettelkasten can capture your thoughts and their relations as you design it that way. Therefore, we recommend limiting each Zettel to one thought each. Then your Zettelkasten will assist you in thinking instead of just assisting in creating excerpts.

In practice, **you need to compromise between taking broad notes and focusing on your current projects.** You cannot just take random notes on what you are interested in and expect to get anything done. So, use your current projects as golden threads to guide your work while allowing a bit of deviation from this path. The amount of deviation depends on what your deadline is.

The benefit of this habit is that you can maintain a flow of writing much more. I cannot count the many good ideas and texts I wrote while technically working on another project. By keeping the flow going you will produce more useful thoughts and text in the long run. The limits of this practice are the how much you _need_ to achieve in the short-term.

Those byproducts are not waste. In the long run, they become valuable knowledge for your future projects. Also, they form connections to other parts of your Zettelkasten and will enrich your personal learning experience while working with the Zettelkasten.

The reference part at the bottom of your Zettel states the sources of the information. The footer is the right place for external sources like books or articles from the web.
