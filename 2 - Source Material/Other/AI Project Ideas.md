1. Calendar + email + docs agent. People don'rt talk about this enough.
	- Summarizing my inbox daily and flagging action items •Booking/rescheduling meetings via email
	- Prepping docs before calls (grabs last meeting notes, LinkedIn bios, recent threads, etc.) 
	-  Drafting follow-up emails after calls
	
	- It’s not flashy, but it saves me like 50 minutes a day of context-switching and mental load. Everyone’s chasing crazy multi-agent systems and building agents to run entire startups (guilty), but I swear the real MVPs are the ones that quietly just… do your admin work.

2. I have MIA, my personal assistant. I can send text or audio messages using Telegram to ask for news, plan trips, or perform everyday tasks. I'm planning to improve with more tools. Do you guys have any suggestions about new tools?

	- I also have a second workflow to help me search for job opportunities on LinkedIn. This workflow uses RSS, understands the opportunity, ranks it using my experience and skills as a base, and creates a cover letter for it if it gets a specific score.
	- My third workflow is to create a draft of my articles. This workflow involves researching (perplexity), writing (Claude), and reviewing using some SEO rules with ChatGPT. Then, using the first version and the report from the SEO agent, I create a second version of the draft.
	- Another workflow has a particular task. When I receive an email from my daugheterś school, this workflow reads, "understand," and if I need to take action, the agent sends me a message on Telegram.
