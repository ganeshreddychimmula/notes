## Impact of Big Beautiful Bill on IT Jobs

### ✅ Positive Impacts

- **💰 Tax Incentives for Tech**
    
    - Section 174 rollback lets companies _immediately deduct software developer salaries_ — a big win for startups and hiring.
        
    - Small business deductions and expensing spur hiring in dev, IT support, cloud, and consulting.
        
- **📈 Economic Growth (0.8–1.2% GDP)**
    
    - Expanding companies invest in tech infra and digital tools.
        
    - Growth in **cloud computing, cybersecurity, and IT consulting** across sectors.
        
- **👥 Small Business Boost**
    
    - Tech startups gain more room to hire engineers and scale ops.
        

### ❌ Negative Impacts

- **🌱 Clean Energy Cuts**
    
    - End of tax credits = up to 686K job losses, including IT roles in smart grid, EV, energy software.
        
- **🏥 Healthcare Cuts**
    
    - $863B from Medicaid, $295B from SNAP → 1.22M job losses.
        
    - Health IT roles (EHRs, informatics, telehealth) at risk, especially in high-poverty states.
        
- **📉 Deficit Risks & Sequestration**
    
    - Adds ~$3T to deficit → risk of future austerity.
        
    - Cuts to Medicare, public sector projects = fewer gov tech jobs.
        

### ⚖️ Uncertain/Neutral Impacts

- **DOGE Spending Cuts**
    
    - $180B in federal cuts, but unclear where. Possible risk to federal IT contractors.
        
- **Defense & Border Boost**
    
    - $95B for wall & detention = potential increase in homeland security IT and surveillance roles.

## IT Roles to Target vs. Avoid

### 🎯 Roles to Target

| Role                      | Why It’s a Good Bet                                     |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Software Developer**    | Section 174 rollback, booming demand in SMBs & startups |
| **Cybersecurity Analyst** | Border/defense spending + rising threat landscape       |
| **Cloud Engineer**        | Digital transformation across industries                |
| **AI/ML Engineer**        | AI adoption + long-term growth (37% projected)          |
| **IT Consultant**         | SMB growth = need for scalable tech & automation        |

💡 _Skills to showcase_: Python, JavaScript, cloud platforms (AWS, Azure), DevOps, AI tools (TensorFlow, PyTorch), security certs (CISSP, CEH).

### ⚠️ Roles to Approach Cautiously

| Role                         | Why It’s Risky                            |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Healthcare IT Specialist** | Medicaid/Medicare cuts reduce investments |
| **Clean Energy IT**          | Loss of credits = shrinking green tech IT |
| **Public Sector IT**         | Budget uncertainty & possible cuts        |
| **Niche Data Scientist**     | Non-profits face safety-net funding cuts  |

💡 _Alternative sectors_: Finance, logistics, private healthtech, AI-driven firms.

### 💼 Strategic Job Search Tips

- **Customize Your Resume**: Tailor to each role, emphasize relevant tech stacks.
    
- **Portfolio First**: GitHub > GPA. Show working projects (especially in AI/dev).
    
- **Certify Skills**: Cloud, AI, or security certs boost credibility.
    
- **Be Visible**: Use LinkedIn, Discord, and job boards (Indeed, Dice, etc.).
    
- **Track Resilient Sectors**: Finance, logistics, defense are more insulated.

## ✅ Final Takeaway

Focus on **developer, cloud, security, AI, and consulting** roles. Avoid heavily **healthcare, clean energy**, or **gov IT** roles for now. The economic uplift may benefit tech, but targeted cuts could eliminate thousands of sector-specific roles.
