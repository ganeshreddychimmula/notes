# Prompts to learn anything
Okay, here are the example prompts suggested in the video, listed by the learning phase they support, along with how they help you learn:

Construct Phase (Building foundational knowledge) 

1. Prompt: "You are an expert at this topic. How would you recommend a beginner learn this topic? Create a syllabus and lesson plan for me to learn this information effectively." [[02:13](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ_flEGANBw&t=133)]  
    

2. How it helps: Structures the learning process, making the topic less overwhelming by providing a clear sequence [[02:24](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ_flEGANBw&t=144)]. 
        
    
3. Prompt: "Then give me a list in bullets of other topics and concepts I should explore to understand this topic more completely and then also tell me why." [[02:29](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ_flEGANBw&t=149)]  
    
4. - How it helps: Further clarifies the learning path and reduces cognitive load [[02:24](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ_flEGANBw&t=144)]. 
        
    
5. Prompt: "Explain the concept of [topic] in simple terms for a beginner, then explain how it relates to the big picture of [related field]." [[02:40](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ_flEGANBw&t=160)]  
    
6. - How it helps: Encourages critical thinking by explaining the concept's importance and its place within a larger context [[02:51](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ_flEGANBw&t=171)]. 
        
    

Connect Phase (Understanding relationships between concepts) 

1. Prompt: "Create a table to compare and contrast topics 1, 2, and 3, and then explain why the relationship of these concepts matters and how it helps me understand this concept as a whole." [[04:21](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ_flEGANBw&t=261)]1  
    
2. - How it helps: Focuses on analyzing similarities and differences between concepts and understanding their collective importance [[04:33](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ_flEGANBw&t=273)]. 
        
    
3. Prompt: "Help me explore additional concepts related to this topic. Give me a table of their similarities and differences, and then explain to me in simple terms why those relationships are important." [[04:42](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ_flEGANBw&t=282)]  
    
4. - How it helps: Helps uncover connections you might have overlooked, deepening your understanding of how concepts relate [[04:48](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ_flEGANBw&t=288)]. 
        
    
5. Prompt: "Thanks, what are other related concepts I might have missed when learning about this topic?" [[04:53](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ_flEGANBw&t=293)]  
    
6. - How it helps: Similar to the previous prompt, it encourages exploration of potentially missed connections [[04:48](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ_flEGANBw&t=288)]. 
        
    
7. Prompt: "Create three analogies to explain this concept to me from different perspectives, and then explain the strength of each analogy and the limitations of it." [[05:29](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ_flEGANBw&t=329)]  
    
8. - How it helps: Makes new concepts more tangible by relating them to familiar2 ones and promotes critical evaluation of these comparisons [[05:35](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ_flEGANBw&t=335)]. 
        
    

Challenge Phase (Testing and refining understanding) 

1. Prompt: "You are a [profession] professor. Create a 10 question short answer practice test on the topics of [topic] to evaluate how well I understand why this topic is important." [[06:28](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ_flEGANBw&t=388)]3  
    
2. - How it helps: Allows you to apply your knowledge and identify weak spots in your understanding [[06:34](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ_flEGANBw&t=394)]. ] 
    
3. Prompt: "Thanks, I just took the test. Now provide me with the answers along with detailed explanations about why the answers are correct and common pitfalls that students make who answer them incorrectly." [[06:56](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ_flEGANBw&t=416)]  
    
4. - How it helps: Provides specific feedback, explains correct reasoning, and highlights common errors to help you refine your understanding [[07:02](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ_flEGANBw&t=422)]. 
        
    
5. Prompt: "I'm learning about this topic. Is my thought process accurate? [Your explanation]. Provide feedback on the strengths and weaknesses of my understanding and which other points to explore for a well-rounded perspective." [[07:21](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ_flEGANBw&t=441)]  
    

- How it helps: Encourages you to articulate your understanding (promoting deeper processing) and provides personalized feedback to address knowledge gaps and suggest further exploration [[07:27](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ_flEGANBw&t=447)].
