# CODA Project
**Project Title:** Organizational Operations Migration from Airtable to Coda

**Project Lead:** Ganeshreddy Chimmula

**1. Objective:** To execute the end-to-end migration of all core organizational operations from our current Airtable workspaces to a new, integrated system built on Coda. The goal is to create a single, unified source of truth that is efficient, scalable, and easy for the team to use.

**2. Background & Context:** I have been assigned as the sole project lead for this initiative. While I will be collaborating with stakeholders for input, I will be responsible for the majority of the planning, execution, and delivery. This is my first opportunity to lead a project of this scope independently.

**3. Key Challenge & Success Criterion:** As a non-profit organization, staff continuity can be a challenge. Therefore, a primary success criterion for this project is the creation of comprehensive and clear documentation. The final system and its supporting documentation must be robust enough for a new team member or volunteer to understand, manage, and continue building upon with minimal handover.

**4. Areas Requiring Guidance:** I am seeking a structured framework and best practices for the following project phases:

- **Phase 1: Discovery & Problem Mapping**
    
    - Methodologies for auditing our existing Airtable bases to identify all active workflows, data structures, automations, and user pain points.
        
- **Phase 2: Solution Architecture & Research**
    
    - Strategic approach to designing the new Coda workspace. How to leverage Coda's unique features (e.g., pages, cross-doc relations, packs) rather than simply replicating Airtable's structure.
        
- **Phase 3: Technical Execution & Rollout**
    
    - A phased implementation plan, including data migration strategies, building a prototype (MVP), user acceptance testing (UAT), and a final launch plan.
        
- **Phase 4: Documentation & Knowledge Management**
    
    - A strategy for creating "living documentation" that is easy to access, update, and use for training and future system administration.
