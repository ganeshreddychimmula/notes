**Source Material**: This folder is dedicated to storing insights gleaned from **all forms of consumed content**. This includes, but is not limited to, books, videos, articles, podcasts, and even Twitter threads.
- **Source Material**: Stores insights from all consumed content (books, videos, articles, podcasts, Twitter threads). You can create optional subfolders for different types. Notes actively being worked on can remain unsorted until finished.

- **Creation of Source Material Notes**:
        - When you encounter something you want to note, you **create a new note in the "Source Material" folder** and title it with the name of the source (e.g., "Confessions of a Cartel Hitman" for a book). If it's an online source, you would include the link.
        - As you review the source, you should **write down page numbers** (if applicable) and **relevant quotes**.
        - **Crucially, you must then expand on these ideas in your own words**. This involves discussing your thoughts, what the idea reminded you of, or explaining it to yourself in a way you truly understand. This active process of rephrasing and reflecting is essential to avoid passive learning and to ensure deeper understanding and retention. Anna Howard notes that these source material notes are primarily for your "own understanding of the source".
        - For example, you might read a book and take a note on a character's loyalty, including the page number, a direct quote, and then your own elaboration on why loyalty is central to gang life or what it means to you. This process is repeated for each interesting idea you encounter in the source.
    - You can create optional subfolders within "Source Material" to categorize different types of content (e.g., "Books," "Videos"), but this is not mandatory. Notes that are actively being worked on can remain unsorted until they are finished.
- **ChatGPT Report**: Based on the described Obsidian folder system and our conversation history, a report from ChatGPT about job market share of different tech stacks would typically go into two main folders, reflecting a two-step process of learning and internalization:

	1. **Source Material Folder:** The **ChatGPT report itself should be placed in your "Source Material" folder**. This folder is designed to "store the insights from anything I consume", which includes not just traditional content like books and articles, but also "videos, articles, podcasts, even Twitter threads". A report generated by ChatGPT, acting as a source of information, fits this definition.
    
	    - You would **create a new note in the "Source Material" folder**, titling it appropriately (e.g., "ChatGPT Report - Tech Stack Job Market Share").
	    - If you have a persistent link to the ChatGPT conversation, you should **include that link** in the note.
	    - Within this note, as you review the report, you should **write down relevant quotes or data points**.
	    - **Crucially, you must then expand on these ideas in your own words** within this source note. This involves discussing your thoughts, what the data reminded you of, or explaining it to yourself in a way you truly understand. This active processing is essential for your "own understanding of the source material" and to avoid passive learning.
    
	2. **Main Notes (Workhorse) Folder:** Once you have processed the information in your "Source Material" note, you would then **create new notes in your "Main Notes" folder**. This is the "core of your system" where your primary, "atomic" notes reside. These notes should be:
	    - **Decontextualized from the specific source material**. While they might _reference_ the ChatGPT report, their primary purpose is to capture **your own thoughts, insights, and conclusions** about the job market and tech stacks.
	    - **Independent and self-explanatory**. They should stand alone, allowing them to "connect freely with other notes" and ideas across your entire knowledge network.
	    - Focused on the **"bigger picture"**. You would ask questions like "so what? why does this matter? what does this mean?" regarding the information from the ChatGPT report, distilling it into key takeaways or broader concepts. For example, if the report highlighted a rise in Python's market share, your main note might be about "The Growing Dominance of Python" or "Factors Influencing Tech Stack Popularity," discussing your analysis of _why_ this is happening and its implications.
		
	 This two-step process helps you to:
	
	- **Slow down and deepen your understanding** of the information, as it forces you to actively rephrase and reflect on what you've consumed. If you struggle to put a concept into your own words, it's a sign you need to go back and understand it better.
	- **Form connections and generate new insights**. By separating your raw source notes from your processed "main notes," your ideas are "free from the restrictions of folders" and can "mingle and connect insights from Socrates Dante and the Bible can connect with those from maybe Virginia wolf or n or any other modern author you can think of". This "interlinks your ideas together" and allows you to "see the ways that all of your interests are interconnected".
	- **Prepare for future creation**. Your main notes become the "building blocks for a book" or "a new article or make a new speech" because "most of the writing was already done in the form of the notes way before the idea of the book even existed". This makes your research reusable and prevents it from being "stuck within the book draft or his article or blog or whatever else he wrote".
	
	Additionally, once you have created your main notes, you should:
	
	- **Apply tags** to them. Tags "are your best friend in navigating your network especially when it gets large". You would create links to empty tag notes stored in your "Tags" folder (e.g., `[Job Market](3%20-%20Tags/Job%20Market.md)`, `[Tech Stacks](Tech%20Stacks)`, `[Programming Languages](Programming%20Languages)`). These tags should be relevant to your personal interests and specific enough to be useful, but not overly precise. Aim for "below four and five most of the time" tags per note.
