In Obsidian, a template is a pre-defined structure or boilerplate for your notes, designed to provide basic organization and streamline your note-taking process. It lives in a dedicated **template folder** within your system.

Here's what can typically be put into a template:

- **Automatic Date and Time**: You can include special syntax (squiggly brackets) in your template that will automatically populate the note with the current date and time when the template is inserted.
- **Status Tag**: This helps categorize the developmental stage of your note. For instance, you might use tags like `#bab` (for new, badly written, or unconnected notes), `#child` (for notes that have been edited and connected more), or `#adult` (for well-developed notes). This allows you to easily identify which notes need more attention or work.
- **Quote Tag**: If you frequently include quotes in your notes, you might add a tag like `#tquote` to easily find them later, which is useful if you like to use quotes in your writing.
- **Title and Headings**:
    - A primary heading (`# Title`) for the note's main title, which can automatically be populated with the note's filename.
    - Subheadings (`##`, `###`, etc.) to provide further structure within the note. The more hashtags you add, the smaller the subheading will be, with six levels available.
- **Blank Space for Writing**: Sufficient blank lines are included to provide an immediate area for you to start writing your main content without hesitation.
- **Reference Section**: At the bottom, a dedicated heading like "Reference" allows you to link to the source material from which the ideas originated (e.g., a specific book or online article note in your "Source Material" folder), as well as any other similar or related notes within your vault. This is crucial for tracing the origin of your thoughts and building connections.

**How to Insert Templates Anywhere:**

To insert a template into a new or existing note, you need to set up the template feature and a hotkey in Obsidian's settings:

1. **Template Folder Setup**: First, ensure you have a dedicated folder for your templates (e.g., "Templates" folder).
2. **Obsidian Settings**:
    - Go to the **"Template" section** within Obsidian's settings.
    - In the top part of this section, **select the folder you created for your templates**.
    - (Optional but Recommended) Go to the **"Hotkeys" section** in settings. Search for "insert template" and **assign a convenient hotkey** to it, such as `Control + T` on Windows or `Command + T` on Mac. This saves mental energy for writing rather than note creation.
    - Ensure the **"Templates" core plugin is turned on** in the "Core Plugin" section of settings.
3. **Inserting the Template**:
    - Once these settings are configured, when you are in a blank note (or any note where you want to insert the template's content), simply **press the hotkey you set up** (e.g., `Ctrl + T` or `Command + T`).
    - This will bring up a menu, allowing you to **select the template** you wish to insert.
    - Upon selection, the template's predefined structure will be immediately pasted into your note, providing instant structure and setting you up for writing without hesitation.

This template system helps you "slap some structure into your note" and set you up for writing without hesitation, allowing you to focus on the "most important value creating activity which is actually thinking, writing out those ideas and expanding those thoughts".
